Abstract
The growth of data, the need for scalability and the complexity of models used in modern
machine learning calls for distributed implementations. Yet, as of today, distributed machine
learning frameworks have largely ignored the possibility of arbitrary (i.e., Byzantine) failures. In
this paper, we study the robustness to Byzantine failures at the fundamental level of stochastic
gradient descent (SGD), the heart of most machine learning algorithms. Assuming a set of n
workers, up to f of them being Byzantine, we ask how robust can SGD be, without limiting the
dimension, nor the size of the parameter space.
We ﬁrst show that no gradient descent update rule based on a linear combination of the
vectors proposed by the workers (i.e, current approaches) tolerates a single Byzantine failure.
We then formulate a resilience property of the update rule capturing the basic requirements to
guarantee convergence despite f Byzantine workers. We ﬁnally propose Krum, an update rule
that satisﬁes the resilience property aforementioned. For a d-dimensional learning problem, the
time complexity of Krum is O(n2 · (d + log n)).

Introduction
Machine learning has received a lot of attention over the past few years. Its applications range
all the way from images classiﬁcation, ﬁnancial trend prediction, disease diagnosis, to gaming and
driving [8].
Most major companies are currently investing in machine learning technologies to
support their businesses [15]. Roughly speaking, machine learning consists in giving a computer
the ability to improve the way it solves a problem with the quantity and quality of information it
can use [17]. In short, the computer has a list of internal parameters, called the parameter vector,
which allows the computer to formulate answers to several questions such as, “is there a cat on this
picture?”. According to how many correct and incorrect answers are provided, a speciﬁc error cost
is associated with the parameter vector. Learning is the process of updating this parameter vector
in order to minimize the cost.
The increasing amount of data involved [4] as well as the growing complexity of models [19]
has led to learning schemes that require a lot of computational resources. As a consequence, most
industry-grade machine-learning implementations are now distributed [1]. For example, as of 2012,
Google reportedly used 16.000 processors to train an image classiﬁer [12]. However, distributing
a computation over several machines induces a higher risk of failures, including crashes and com-
putation errors. In the worst case, the system may undergo Byzantine failures [9], i.e., completely
arbitrary behaviors of some of the machines involved.
In practice, such failures may be due to
stalled processes, or biases in the way the data samples are distributed among the processes.
A classical approach to mask failures in distributed systems is to use a state machine replication
protocol [18], which requires however state transitions to be applied by all processes. In the case
of distributed machine learning, this constraint can be seen in two ways: either (a) the processes
agree on a sample of data based on which they update their local parameter vectors, or (b) they
agree on how the parameter vector should be updated. In case (a), the sample of data has to be
transmitted to each process, which then has to perform a heavyweight computation to update its
local parameter vector. This entails communication and computational costs that defeat the entire
purpose of distributing the work. In case (b), the processes have no way to check if the chosen
update for the parameter vector has indeed been computed correctly on real data (a Byzantine
process could have proposed the update). Byzantine failures may easily prevent the convergence of
the learning algorithm. Neither of these solutions is satisfactory in a realistic distributed machine
learning setting.
In fact, most learning algorithms today rely on a core component, namely stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) [3,6], whether for training neural networks [6], regression [25], matrix factorization [5]
or support vector machines [25]. In all those cases, a cost function – depending on the parameter
vector – is minimized based on stochastic estimates of its gradient. Distributed implementations of
SGD [24] typically take the following form: a single parameter server is in charge of updating the
parameter vector, while worker processes perform the actual update estimation, based on the share
of data they have access to. More speciﬁcally, the parameter server executes synchronous rounds,
during each of which, the parameter vector is broadcast to the workers.
In turn, each worker
computes an estimate of the update to apply (an estimate of the gradient), and the parameter
server aggregates their results to ﬁnally update the parameter vector. Today, this aggregation is
typically implemented through averaging [16], or variants of it [10,23,24].
The question we address in this paper is how a distributed SGD can be devised to tolerate f
Byzantine processes among the n workers.
Contributions.
We ﬁrst show in this paper that no linear combination (current approaches)
of the updates proposed by the workers can tolerate a single Byzantine worker.
Basically, the
1

--- Page 3 ---
Byzantine worker can force the parameter server to choose any arbitrary vector, even one that is
too large in amplitude or too far in direction from the other vectors. Clearly, the Byzantine worker
can prevent any classic averaging-based approach to converge. Choosing the appropriate update
from the vectors proposed by the workers turns out to be challenging. A non-linear, distance-based
choice function, that chooses, among the proposed vectors, the vector “closest to everyone else” (for
example by taking the vector that minimizes the sum of the distances to every other vector), might
look appealing. Yet, such a distance-based choice tolerates only a single Byzantine worker. Two
Byzantine workers can collude, one helping the other to be selected, by moving the barycenter of
all the vectors farther from the “correct area”.
We formulate a Byzantine resilience property capturing suﬃcient conditions for the parameter
server’s choice to tolerate f Byzantine workers. Essentially, to guarantee that the cost will decrease
despite Byzantine workers, we require the parameter server’s choice (a) to point, on average, to
the same direction as the gradient and (b) to have statistical moments (up to the fourth moment)
bounded above by a homogeneous polynomial in the moments of a correct estimator of the gradient.
One way to ensure such a resilience property is to consider a majority-based approach, looking at
every subset of n −f vectors, and considering the subset with the smallest diameter. While this
approach is more robust to Byzantine workers that propose vectors far from the correct area,
its exponential computational cost is prohibitive.
Interestingly, combining the intuitions of the
majority-based and distance-based methods, we can choose the vector that is somehow the closest
to its n −f neighbors. Namely, the one that minimizes a distance-based criteria, but only within
its n −f neighbors. This is the main idea behind our choice function we call Krum1. Assuming
2f + 2 < n, we show (using techniques from multi-dimensional stochastic calculus) that our Krum
function satisﬁes the resilience property aforementioned and the corresponding machine learning
scheme converges. An important advantage of the Krum function is that it requires O(n2·(d+log n))
local computation time, where d is the dimension of the parameter vector. (In modern machine
learning, the dimension d of the parameter vector may take values in the hundreds of billions [22].)
For simplicity of presentation, we ﬁrst introduce a version of the Krum function that selects only
one vector. Then we discuss how this method can be iterated to leverage the contribution of more
than one single correct worker.
Paper Organization.
Section 2 recalls the classical model of distributed SGD. Section 3 proves
that linear combinations (solutions used today) are not resilient even to a single Byzantine worker,
then introduces the new concept of (α, f)-Byzantine resilience. In Section 4, we introduce the Krum
function, compute its computational cost and prove its (α, f)-Byzantine resilience. In Section 5 we
analyze the convergence of a distributed SGD using our Krum function. In Section 6 we discuss
how Krum can be iterated to leverage the contribution of more workers. Finally, we discuss related
work and open problems in Section 7.

Model
We consider a general distributed system consisting of a parameter server2 [1], and n workers, f
of them possibly Byzantine (behaving arbitrarily). Computation is divided into (inﬁnitely many)
synchronous rounds. During round t, the parameter server broadcasts its parameter vector xt ∈Rd
to all the workers. Each correct worker p computes an estimate V t
p = G(xt, ξt
p) of the gradient
1Krum, in Greek Κρούμος, was a Bulgarian Khan of the end of the eighth century, who undertook oﬀensive attacks
against the Byzantine empire. Bulgaria doubled in size during his reign.
2The parameter server is assumed to be reliable. Classical techniques of state-machine replication can be used to
avoid this single point of failure.

∇Q(xt) of the cost function Q, where ξt
p is a random variable representing, e.g., the sample drawn
from the dataset. A Byzantine worker b proposes a vector V t
b which can be arbitrary (see Figure 1).
Figure 1: The gradient estimates computed by
correct workers (black dashed arrows) are dis-
tributed around the actual gradient (blue solid
arrow) of the cost function (thin black curve). A
Byzantine worker can propose an arbitrary vector
(red dotted arrow).
Note that, since the communication is syn-
chronous, if the parameter server does not re-
ceive a vector value V t
b from a given Byzantine
worker b, then the parameter server acts as if it
had received the default value V t
b = 0 instead.
The parameter server computes a vector
F(V t
1 , . . . , V t
n) by applying a deterministic func-
tion F to the vectors received. We refer to F
as the choice function of the parameter server.
The parameter server updates the parameter
vector using the following SGD equation
xt+1 = xt −γt · F(V t
1 , . . . , V t
n).
In this paper, we assume that the correct
(non-Byzantine) workers compute unbiased es-
timates of the gradient ∇Q(xt). More precisely, in every round t, the vectors V t
i ’s proposed by
the correct workers are independent identically distributed random vectors, V t
i ∼G(xt, ξt
i) with
EG(xt, ξt
i) = ∇Q(xt). This can be achieved by ensuring that each sample of data used for comput-
ing the gradient is drawn uniformly and independently, as classically assumed in the literature of
machine learning [2].
The Byzantine workers have full knowledge of the system, including the choice function F, the
vectors proposed by the other workers and can collaborate with each other [11].

Byzantine Resilience
In most SGD-based learning algorithms used today [3,5,6,25], the choice function consists in com-
puting the average of the input vectors. Lemma 1 below states that no linear combination of the
vectors can tolerate a single Byzantine worker. In particular, averaging is not robust to Byzantine
failures.
Lemma 1. Consider a choice function Flin of the form
Flin(V1, . . . , Vn) =
n
X
i=1
λi · Vi.
where the λi’s are non-zero scalars. Let U be any vector in Rd. A single Byzantine worker can make
F always select U. In particular, a single Byzantine worker can prevent convergence.
Proof. If the Byzantine worker proposes vector Vn =
1
λn · U −Pn−1
i=1
λi
λn Vi, then F = U. Note that
the parameter server could cancel the eﬀects of the Byzantine behavior by setting, for example, λn
to 0, but this requires means to detect which worker is Byzantine.
In the following, we deﬁne basic requirements on an appropriate robust choice function. Intu-
itively, the choice function should output a vector F that is not too far from the “real” gradient g,
more precisely, the vector that points to the steepest direction of the cost function being optimized.
This is expressed as a lower bound (condition (i)) on the scalar product of the (expected) vector F

and g. Figure 2 illustrates the situation geometrically. If EF belongs to the ball centered at g with
radius r, then the scalar product is bounded below by a term involving sin α = r/∥g∥.
Condition (ii) is more technical, and states that the moments of F should be controlled by the
moments of the (correct) gradient estimator G. The bounds on the moments of G are classically
used to control the eﬀects of the discrete nature of the SGD dynamics [2]. Condition (ii) allows to
transfer this control to the choice function.
Deﬁnition 1 ((α, f)-Byzantine Resilience). Let 0 ≤α < π/2 be any angular value, and any integer
0 ≤f ≤n. Let V1, . . . , Vn be any independent identically distributed random vectors in Rd, Vi ∼G,
with EG = g. Let B1, . . . , Bf be any random vectors in Rd, possibly dependent on the Vi’s. Choice
function F is said to be (α, f)-Byzantine resilient if, for any 1 ≤j1 < · · · < jf ≤n, the vector
F = F(V1, . . . , B1
|{z}
j1
, . . . , Bf
|{z}

, . . . , Vn)
satisﬁes (i) ⟨EF, g⟩≥(1 −sin α) · ∥g∥2 > 0 and (ii) for r = 2, 3, 4, E ∥F∥r is bounded above by a
linear combination of terms E ∥G∥r1 . . . E ∥G∥rn−1 with r1 + · · · + rn−1 = r.

The Krum Function
We now introduce Krum, our choice function, which, we show, satisﬁes the (α, f)-Byzantine re-
silience condition. The barycentric choice function Fbary = 1
n
Pn
i=1 Vi can be deﬁned as the vector
in Rd that minimizes the sum of squared distances to the Vi’s Pn
i=1 ∥Fbary −Vi∥2. Lemma 1, how-
ever, states that this approach does not tolerate even a single Byzantine failure. One could try
to deﬁne the choice function in order to select, among the Vi’s, the vector U ∈{V1, . . . , Vn} that
minimizes the sum P
i ∥U −Vi∥2. Intuitively, vector U would be close to every proposed vector,
including the correct ones, and thus would be close to the “real” gradient. However, all Byzantine
workers but one may propose vectors that are large enough to move the total barycenter far away
from the correct vectors, while the remaining Byzantine worker proposes this barycenter. Since the
barycenter always minimizes the sum of squared distance, this last Byzantine worker is certain to
have its vector chosen by the parameter server. This situation is depicted in Figure 3. In other
words, since this choice function takes into account all the vectors, including the very remote ones,
the Byzantine workers can collude to force the choice of the parameter server.
Our approach to circumvent this issue is to preclude the vectors that are too far away. More
precisely, we deﬁne our Krum choice function Kr(V1, . . . , Vn) as follows. For any i ̸= j, we denote
by i →j the fact that Vj belongs to the n −f −2 closest vectors to Vi. Then, we deﬁne for each
worker i, the score s(i) = P
i→j ∥Vi −Vj∥2 where the sum runs over the n −f −2 closest vectors to
4

Figure 3: Selecting the vector that minimizes the sum of the squared distances to other vectors
does not prevent arbitrary vectors proposed by Byzantine workers from being selected if f ≥2. If
the gradients computed by the correct workers lie in area C, the Byzantine workers can collude to
propose up to f −1 vectors in an arbitrarily remote area B, thus allowing another Byzantine vector
b, close to the barycenter of proposed vectors, to be selected.
Vi. Finally, Kr(V1, . . . , Vn) = Vi∗where i∗refers to the worker minimizing the score, s(i∗) ≤s(i)
for all i.3
Lemma 2. The time complexity of the Krum Function Kr(V1, . . . , Vn), where V1, . . . , Vn are d-
dimensional vectors, is O(n2 · (d + log n))
Proof. For each Vi, the parameter server computes the n squared distances ∥Vi −Vj∥2 (time O(n·d)).
Then the parameter server sorts these distances (time O(n·log n)) and sums the ﬁrst n−f −1 values
(time O(n·d)). Thus, computing the score of all the Vi’s takes O(n2·(d+log n)). An additional term
O(n) is required to ﬁnd the minimum score, but is negligible relatively to O(n2 · (d + log n)).
Proposition 1 below states that, if 2f + 2 < n and the gradient estimator is accurate enough,
(its standard deviation is relatively small compared to the norm of the gradient), then the Krum
function is (α, f)-Byzantine-resilient, where angle α depends on the ratio of the deviation over the
gradient. When the Krum function selects a correct vector (i.e., a vector proposed by a correct
worker), the proof of this fact is relatively easy, since the probability distribution of this correct
vector is that of the gradient estimator G.
The core diﬃculty occurs when the Krum function
selects a Byzantine vector (i.e., a vector proposed by a Byzantine worker), because the distribution
of this vector is completely arbitrary, and may even depend on the correct vectors. In a very general
sense, this part of our proof is reminiscent of the median technique: the median of n > 2f scalar
values is always bounded below and above by values proposed by correct workers. Extending this
observation to our multi-dimensional is not trivial. To do so, we notice that the chosen Byzantine
vector Bk has a score not greater than any score of a correct worker. This allows us to derive an
upper bound on the distance between Bk and the real gradient. This upper bound involves a sum of
distances from correct to correct neighbor vectors, and distances from correct to Byzantine neighbor
vectors. As explained above, the ﬁrst term is relatively easy to control. For the second term, we
observe that a correct vector Vi has n −f −2 neighbors (the n −f −2 closest vectors to Vi), and
f + 1 non-neighbors. In particular, the distance from any (possibly Byzantine) neighbor Vj to Vi is
bounded above by a correct to correct vector distance. In other words, we manage to control the
distance between the chosen Byzantine vector and the real gradient by an upper bound involving
only distances between vectors proposed by correct workers.
Proposition 1. Let V1, . . . , Vn be any independent and identically distributed random d-dimensional
vectors s.t Vi ∼G, with EG = g and E ∥G −g∥2 = dσ2. Let B1, . . . , Bf be any f random vectors,
possibly dependent on the Vi’s. If 2f + 2 < n and η(n, f)

then the Krum function Kr is (α, f)-Byzantine resilient where 0 ≤α < π/2 is deﬁned by
sin α = η(n, f) ·

.
The condition on the norm of the gradient, η(n, f) ·
√
d · σ < ∥g∥, can be satisﬁed, to a certain
extent, by having the (correct) workers computing their gradient estimates on mini-batches [2].
Indeed, averaging the gradient estimates over a mini-batch divides the deviation σ by the squared
root of the size of the mini-batch.
Proof. Without loss of generality, we assume that the Byzantine vectors B1, . . . , Bf occupy the last
f positions in the list of arguments of Kr, i.e., Kr = Kr(V1, . . . , Vn−f, B1, . . . , Bf). An index is
correct if it refers to a vector among V1, . . . , Vn−f. An index is Byzantine if it refers to a vector
among B1, . . . , Bf. For each index (correct or Byzantine) i, we denote by δc(i) (resp. δb(i)) the
number of correct (resp. Byzantine) indices j such that i →j. We have
δc(i)+δb(i) = n −f −2
n −2f −2 ≤δc(i) ≤n −f −2
δb(i) ≤f.
We focus ﬁrst on the condition (i) of (α, f)-Byzantine resilience. We determine an upper bound on
the squared distance ∥EKr −g∥2. Note that, for any correct j, EVj = g. We denote by i∗the index
of the vector chosen by the Krum function.

Convergence Analysis
In this section, we analyze the convergence of the SGD using our Krum function deﬁned in Section 4.
The SGD equation is expressed as follows
xt+1 = xt −γt · Kr(V t
1 , . . . , V t
n)
where at least n−f vectors among the V t
i ’s are correct, while the other ones may be Byzantine. For
a correct index i, V t
i = G(xt, ξt
i) where G is the gradient estimator. We deﬁne the local standard
deviation σ(x) by
d · σ2(x) = E ∥G(x, ξ) −∇Q(x)∥2 .
The following proposition considers an (a priori) non-convex cost function. In the context of
non-convex optimization, even in the centralized case, it is generally hopeless to aim at proving
that the parameter vector xt tends to a local minimum. Many criteria may be used instead. We
follow [2], and we prove that the parameter vector xt almost surely reaches a “ﬂat” region (where
the norm of the gradient is small), in a sense explained below.
Proposition 2. We assume that (i) the cost function Q is three times diﬀerentiable with continuous
derivatives, and is non-negative, Q(x) ≥0; (ii) the learning rates satisfy P
t γt = ∞and P
t γ2
t < ∞;
(iii) the gradient estimator satisﬁes EG(x, ξ) = ∇Q(x) and ∀r ∈{2, . . . , 4}, E∥G(x, ξ)∥r ≤Ar +
Br∥x∥r for some constants Ar, Br; (iv) there exists a constant 0 ≤α < π/2 such that for all x
η(n, f) ·
√
d · σ(x) ≤∥∇Q(x)∥· sin α;

(v) ﬁnally, beyond a certain horizon, ∥x∥2 ≥D, there exist ǫ > 0 and 0 ≤β < π/2 −α such that
∥∇Q(x)∥≥ǫ > 0
⟨x, ∇Q(x)⟩
∥x∥· ∥∇Q(x)∥≥cos β.
Then the sequence of gradients ∇Q(xt) converges almost surely to zero.
Conditions (i) to (iv) are the same conditions as in the non-convex convergence analysis in [2].
Condition (v) is a slightly stronger condition than the corresponding one in [2], and states that,
beyond a certain horizon, the cost function Q is “convex enough”, in the sense that the direction
of the gradient is suﬃciently close to the direction of the parameter vector x.
Condition (iv),
however, states that the gradient estimator used by the correct workers has to be accurate enough,
i.e., the local standard deviation should be small relatively to the norm of the gradient. Of course,
the norm of the gradient tends to zero near, e.g., extremal and saddle points. Actually, the ratio
η(n, f) ·
√
d · σ/ ∥∇Q∥controls the maximum angle between the gradient ∇Q and the vector chosen
by the Krum function. In the regions where ∥∇Q∥< η(n, f) ·
√
d · σ, the Byzantine workers may
take advantage of the noise (measured by σ) in the gradient estimator G to bias the choice of
the parameter server. Therefore, Proposition 2 is to be interpreted as follows: in the presence of
Byzantine workers, the parameter vector xt almost surely reaches a basin around points where the
gradient is small (∥∇Q∥≤η(n, f) ·
√
d · σ), i.e., points where the cost landscape is “almost ﬂat”.
Note that the convergence analysis is based only on the fact that function Kr is (α, f)-Byzantine
resilient. Due to space limitation, the complete proof of Proposition 2 is deferred to the Appendix.
Proof. For the sake of simplicity, we write Krt = Kr(V t
1 , . . . , V t
n). Before proving the main claim
of the proposition, we ﬁrst show that the sequence xt is almost surely globally conﬁned within the
region ∥x∥2 ≤D.
(Global conﬁnement).
Let ut = φ(∥xt∥2) where
φ(a) =

Note that
φ(b) −φ(a) ≤(b −a)φ′(a) + (b −a)2.

This becomes an equality when a, b ≥D. Applying this inequality to ut+1 −ut yields

Let Pt denote the σ-algebra encoding all the information up to round t. Taking the conditional

Thanks to condition (ii) of (α, f)-Byzantine resilience, and the assumption on the ﬁrst four moments
of G, there exist positive constants A0, B0 such that
E (ut+1 −ut|Pt) ≤−2γt⟨xt, EKrt⟩φ′(∥xt∥2) + γ2

 A0 + B0∥xt∥4
.
Thus, there exist positive constant A, B such that
E (ut+1 −ut|Pt) ≤−2γt⟨xt, EKrt⟩φ′(∥xt∥2) + γ2
t (A + B · ut) .
When ∥xt∥2 < D, the ﬁrst term of the right hand side is null because φ′(∥xt∥2) = 0.
When
∥xt∥2 ≥D, this ﬁrst term is negative because (see Figure 4)
⟨xt, EKrt⟩≥∥xt∥· ∥EKrt∥· cos(α + β) > 0.
Hence
E (ut+1 −ut|Pt) ≤γ2
t (A + B · ut) .

The right-hand side of the previous inequality is the summand of a convergent series. By the quasi-
martingale convergence theorem [14], this shows that the sequence u′
t converges almost surely, which
in turn shows that the sequence ut converges almost surely, ut →u∞≥0.
10

--- Page 12 ---
Let us assume that u∞> 0. When t is large enough, this implies that ∥xt∥2 and ∥xt+1∥2 are
greater than D. Inequality 1 becomes an equality, which implies that the following inﬁnite sum
converges almost surely
∞
X
t=1
γt⟨xt, EKrt⟩φ′(∥xt∥2) < ∞.
Note that the sequence φ′(∥xt∥2) converges to a positive value. In the region ∥xt∥2 > D, we have
⟨xt, EKrt⟩≥

D · ∥EKrt∥· cos(α + β)

√
D · ǫ · (1 −sin α) · cos(α + β) > 0.
This contradicts the fact that P∞
t=1 γt = ∞. Therefore, the sequence ut converges to zero. This
convergence implies that the sequence ∥xt∥2 is bounded, i.e., the vector xt is conﬁned in a bounded
region containing the origin. As a consequence, any continuous function of xt is also bounded,
such as, e.g., ∥xt∥2, E ∥G(xt, ξ)∥2 and all the derivatives of the cost function Q(xt). In the sequel,
positive constants K1, K2, etc. . . are introduced whenever such a bound is used.
(Convergence).
We proceed to show that the gradient ∇Q(xt) converges almost surely to zero. We
deﬁne
ht = Q(xt).
Using a ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion and bounding the second derivative with K1, we obtain
|ht+1 −ht + 2γt⟨Krt, ∇Q(xt)⟩| ≤γ2
t ∥Krt∥2K1 a.s.
Therefore
E (ht+1 −ht|Pt) ≤−2γt⟨EKrt, ∇Q(xt)⟩+ γ2
t E
 ∥Krt∥2|Pt

K1.
(2)
By the properties of (α, f)-Byzantine resiliency, this implies
E (ht+1 −ht|Pt) ≤γ2
t K2K1,
which in turn implies that the positive variations of ht are also bounded
E (χt · (ht+1 −ht)) ≤γ2
t K2K1.
The right-hand side is the summand of a convergent inﬁnite sum. By the quasi-martingale conver-
gence theorem, the sequence ht converges almost surely, Q(xt) →Q∞.
Taking the expectation of Inequality 2, and summing on t = 1, . . . , ∞, the convergence of Q(xt)
implies that
∞
X
t=1
γt⟨EKrt, ∇Q(xt)⟩< ∞a.s.
We now deﬁne
ρt = ∥∇Q(xt)∥2 .
Using a Taylor expansion, as demonstrated for the variations of ht, we obtain
ρt+1 −ρt ≤−2γt⟨Krt,
 ∇2Q(xt)

· ∇Q(xt)⟩+ γ2
t ∥Krt∥2 K3 a.s.
11

--- Page 13 ---
Taking the conditional expectation, and bounding the second derivatives by K4,
E (ρt+1 −ρt|Pt) ≤2γt⟨EKrt, ∇Q(xt)⟩K4 + γ2
t K2K3.
The positive expected variations of ρt are bounded
E (χt · (ρt+1 −ρt)) ≤2γtE⟨EKrt, ∇Q(xt)⟩K4 + γ2
t K2K3.
The two terms on the right-hand side are the summands of convergent inﬁnite series.
By the
quasi-martingale convergence theorem, this shows that ρt converges almost surely.
We have
⟨EKrt, ∇Q(xt)⟩≥

∥∇Q(xt)∥−η(n, f) ·

d · σ(xt)

This implies that the following inﬁnite series converge almost surely
∞
X
t=1
γt · ρt < ∞.
Since ρt converges almost surely, and the series P∞
t=1 γt = ∞diverges, we conclude that the sequence
∥∇Q(xt)∥converges almost surely to zero.

m-Krum
So far, for the sake of simplicity, we deﬁned our Krum function so that it selects only one vector
among the n vectors proposed. In fact, the parameter server could avoid wasting the contribution
of the other workers by selecting m vectors instead. This can be achieved, for instance, by selecting
one vector using the Krum function, removing it from the list, and iterating this scheme m −1
times, as long as n −m > 2f + 2. We then deﬁne accordingly the m-Krum function
Krm(V1, . . . , Vn) = 1
m
m
X
s=1
Vis∗
where the Vis∗’s are the m vectors selected as explained above. Note that the 1-Krum function is
the Krum function deﬁned in Section 4.
Proposition 3. Let V1, . . . , Vn be any iid random d-dimensional vectors, Vi ∼G, with EG = g and
E ∥G −g∥2 = dσ2. Let B1, . . . , Bf be any f random vectors, possibly dependent on the Vi’s. Assume
that 2f +2 < n−m and η(n, f)
√
d ·σ < ∥g∥. Then, for large enough n, the m-Krum function Krm
is (α, f)-Byzantine resilient where 0 ≤α < π/2 is deﬁned by
sin α = η(n, f) ·
√
d · σ
∥g∥
.
12

--- Page 14 ---
Proof (Sketch). For large enough n, function η(n, f) is increasing in the variable n. In particular,
for all i ∈[0, m −1], η(n −i, f) ≤η(n, f). For each iteration i from 0 to m −1, Proposition 1 holds
(replacing n by n−i since n−m > 2f +2) and guarantees that each vector among the m vectors falls
under the deﬁnition of (αi, f)-Byzantine-resilience, where 1−sin(αi) = 1−η(n−i,f)·
√
d·σ
∥g∥
≥1−sin α.
Then, ⟨EKrm, g⟩≥1

(1 −sin αi) · ∥g∥2 ≥(1 −sin α) · ∥g∥2. The moments are bounded above
by a linear combination of the upper-bounds on the moments of each of the m vectors.

Concluding Remarks
At ﬁrst glance, the Byzantine-resilient machine problem we address in this paper can be related
to multi-dimensional approximate agreement [7,13].
Yet, results in d-dimensional approximate
agreement cannot be applied in our context for the following reasons: (a) [7,13] assume that the
set of vectors that can be proposed to an instance of the agreement is bounded so that at least
f + 1 correct workers propose the same vector, which would require a lot of redundant work in
our setting; and most importantly, (b) [13] requires a local computation by each worker that is in
O(nd). While this cost seems reasonable for small dimensions, such as, e.g., mobile robots meeting
in a 2D or 3D space, it becomes a real issue in the context of machine learning, where d may be as
high as 160 billion [22] (making d a crucial parameter when considering complexities, either for local
computations, or for communication rounds). In our case, the complexity of the Krum function is
O(n2 · (d + log n)).
A closer approach to ours has been recently proposed in [20,21]. In [20], the authors assume
a bounded gradient, and their work was an important step towards Byzantine-tolerant machine
learning. However, their study only deals with parameter vectors of dimension one. In [21] the
authors tackle a multi-dimensional situation, using an iterated approximate Byzantine agreement
that reaches consensus asymptotically. This is however only achieved on a ﬁnite set of possible
environmental states and cannot be used in the continuous context of stochastic gradient descent.
The present work oﬀers many possible extensions. First, the question of whether the bound
2f + 2 < n is tight remains open, so is the question on how to tolerate both asynchrony and
Byzantine workers. Second, we have shown that our scheme forces the parameter vector to reach
a region where the gradient is small relatively to η ·
√
d · σ. The question of whether the factor
η(n, f) = O(n) can be made smaller also remains open. Third, the m-Krum function iterates the
1-Krum function m times, multiplying by m the overall computation complexity. An alternative
is to select the ﬁrst m vectors after computing the score as in the Krum function. Proving the
(α, f)-Byzantine-resilience of this alternative remains open.
