Abstract
Contrastive learning applied to self-supervised representation learning has seen
a resurgence in recent years, leading to state of the art performance in the unsu-
pervised training of deep image models. Modern batch contrastive approaches
subsume or signiﬁcantly outperform traditional contrastive losses such as triplet,
max-margin and the N-pairs loss. In this work, we extend the self-supervised
batch contrastive approach to the fully-supervised setting, allowing us to effec-
tively leverage label information. Clusters of points belonging to the same class
are pulled together in embedding space, while simultaneously pushing apart clus-
ters of samples from different classes. We analyze two possible versions of the
supervised contrastive (SupCon) loss, identifying the best-performing formula-
tion of the loss. On ResNet-200, we achieve top-1 accuracy of 81.4% on the Ima-
geNet dataset, which is 0.8% above the best number reported for this architecture.
We show consistent outperformance over cross-entropy on other datasets and two
ResNet variants. The loss shows beneﬁts for robustness to natural corruptions,
and is more stable to hyperparameter settings such as optimizers and data aug-
mentations. Our loss function is simple to implement and reference TensorFlow
code is released at https://t.ly/supcon 1.

Introduction
Figure 1: Our SupCon loss consistently outper-
forms cross-entropy with standard data augmenta-
tions. We show top-1 accuracy for the ImageNet
dataset, on ResNet-50, ResNet-101 and ResNet-
200, and compare against AutoAugment [5], Ran-
dAugment [6] and CutMix [60].
The cross-entropy loss is the most widely used loss
function for supervised learning of deep classiﬁca-
tion models.
A number of works have explored
shortcomings of this loss, such as lack of robustness
to noisy labels [64, 46] and the possibility of poor
margins [10, 31], leading to reduced generalization
performance. However, in practice, most proposed
alternatives have not worked better for large-scale
datasets, such as ImageNet [7], as evidenced by the
continued use of cross-entropy to achieve state of the
art results [5, 6, 56, 25].

Figure 2: Supervised vs. self-supervised contrastive losses: The self-supervised contrastive loss (left, Eq. 1)
contrasts a single positive for each anchor (i.e., an augmented version of the same image) against a set of
negatives consisting of the entire remainder of the batch. The supervised contrastive loss (right) considered
in this paper (Eq. 2), however, contrasts the set of all samples from the same class as positives against the
negatives from the remainder of the batch. As demonstrated by the photo of the black and white puppy, taking
class label information into account results in an embedding space where elements of the same class are more
closely aligned than in the self-supervised case.
In recent years, a resurgence of work in contrastive learning has led to major advances in self-
supervised representation learning [55, 18, 38, 48, 22, 3, 15]. The common idea in these works is the
following: pull together an anchor and a “positive” sample in embedding space, and push apart the
anchor from many “negative” samples. Since no labels are available, a positive pair often consists of
data augmentations of the sample, and negative pairs are formed by the anchor and randomly chosen
samples from the minibatch. This is depicted in Fig. 2 (left). In [38, 48], connections are made of
the contrastive loss to maximization of mutual information between different views of the data.
In this work, we propose a loss for supervised learning that builds on the contrastive self-supervised
literature by leveraging label information. Normalized embeddings from the same class are pulled
closer together than embeddings from different classes. Our technical novelty in this work is to
consider many positives per anchor in addition to many negatives (as opposed to self-supervised
contrastive learning which uses only a single positive). These positives are drawn from samples
of the same class as the anchor, rather than being data augmentations of the anchor, as done in
self-supervised learning. While this is a simple extension to the self-supervised setup, it is non-
obvious how to setup the loss function correctly, and we analyze two alternatives. Fig. 2 (right) and
Fig. 1 (Supplementary) provide a visual explanation of our proposed loss. Our loss can be seen as
a generalization of both the triplet [53] and N-pair losses [45]; the former uses only one positive
and one negative sample per anchor, and the latter uses one positive and many negatives. The use of
many positives and many negatives for each anchor allows us to achieve state of the art performance
without the need for hard negative mining, which can be difﬁcult to tune properly. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst contrastive loss to consistently perform better than cross-entropy on
large-scale classiﬁcation problems. Furthermore, it provides a unifying loss function that can be
used for either self-supervised or supervised learning.
Our resulting loss, SupCon, is simple to implement and stable to train, as our empirical results show.
It achieves excellent top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet dataset on the ResNet-50 and ResNet-200
architectures [17]. On ResNet-200 [5], we achieve a top-1 accuracy of 81.4%, which is a 0.8%
improvement over the state of the art [30] cross-entropy loss on the same architecture (see Fig. 1).
The gain in top-1 accuracy is accompanied by increased robustness as measured on the ImageNet-C
dataset [19]. Our main contributions are summarized below:
1. We propose a novel extension to the contrastive loss function that allows for multiple positives
per anchor, thus adapting contrastive learning to the fully supervised setting. Analytically and
empirically, we show that a na¨ıve extension performs much worse than our proposed version.

2. We show that our loss provides consistent boosts in top-1 accuracy for a number of datasets. It is
also more robust to natural corruptions.
3. We demonstrate analytically that the gradient of our loss function encourages learning from hard
positives and hard negatives.
4. We show empirically that our loss is less sensitive than cross-entropy to a range of hyperparam-
eters.

Related Work
Our work draws on existing literature in self-supervised representation learning, metric learning
and supervised learning. Here we focus on the most relevant papers. The cross-entropy loss was
introduced as a powerful loss function to train deep networks [40, 1, 29]. The key idea is simple
and intuitive: each class is assigned a target (usually 1-hot) vector. However, it is unclear why
these target labels should be the optimal ones and some work has tried to identify better target label
vectors, e.g. [57]. A number of papers have studied other drawbacks of the cross-entropy loss,
such as sensitivity to noisy labels [64, 46], presence of adversarial examples [10, 36], and poor
margins [2]. Alternative losses have been proposed, but the most effective ideas in practice have
been approaches that change the reference label distribution, such as label smoothing [47, 35], data
augmentations such as Mixup [61] and CutMix [60], and knowledge distillation [21].
Powerful self-supervised representation learning approaches based on deep learning models have
recently been developed in the natural language domain [8, 58, 33]. In the image domain, pixel-
predictive approaches have also been used to learn embeddings [9, 62, 63, 37]. These methods
try to predict missing parts of the input signal. However, a more effective approach has been to
replace a dense per-pixel predictive loss, with a loss in lower-dimensional representation space. The
state of the art family of models for self-supervised representation learning using this paradigm are
collected under the umbrella of contrastive learning [55, 18, 22, 48, 43, 3, 51]. In these works,
the losses are inspired by noise contrastive estimation [13, 34] or N-pair losses [45]. Typically, the
loss is applied at the last layer of a deep network. At test time, the embeddings from a previous
layer are utilized for downstream transfer tasks, ﬁne tuning or direct retrieval tasks. [15] introduces
the approximation of only back-propagating through part of the loss, and also the approximation of
using stale representations in the form of a memory bank.
Closely related to contrastive learning is the family of losses based on metric distance learning or
triplets [4, 53, 42]. These losses have been used to learn powerful representations, often in super-
vised settings, where labels are used to guide the choice of positive and negative pairs. The key
distinction between triplet losses and contrastive losses is the number of positive and negative pairs
per data point; triplet losses use exactly one positive and one negative pair per anchor. In the super-
vised metric learning setting, the positive pair is chosen from the same class and the negative pair
is chosen from other classes, nearly always requiring hard-negative mining for good performance
[42]. Self-supervised contrastive losses similarly use just one positive pair for each anchor sample,
selected using either co-occurrence [18, 22, 48] or data augmentation [3]. The major difference is
that many negative pairs are used for each anchor. These are usually chosen uniformly at random
using some form of weak knowledge, such as patches from other images, or frames from other ran-
domly chosen videos, relying on the assumption that this approach yields a very low probability of
false negatives.
Resembling our supervised contrastive approach is the soft-nearest neighbors loss introduced in [41]
and used in [54]. Like [54], we improve upon [41] by normalizing the embeddings and replacing
euclidean distance with inner products. We further improve on [54] by the increased use of data
augmentation, a disposable contrastive head and two-stage training (contrastive followed by cross-
entropy), and crucially, changing the form of the loss function to signiﬁcantly improve results (see
Section 3). [12] also uses a closely related loss formulation to ours to entangle representations at
intermediate layers by maximizing the loss. Most similar to our method is the Compact Clustering
via Label Propagation (CCLP) regularizer in Kamnitsas et. al. [24]. While CCLP focuses mostly
on the semi-supervised case, in the fully supervised case the regularizer reduces to almost exactly
our loss formulation. Important practical differences include our normalization of the contrastive
embedding onto the unit sphere, tuning of a temperature parameter in the contrastive objective, and
stronger augmentation. Additionally, Kamnitsas et. al. use the contrastive embedding as an input to
a classiﬁcation head, which is trained jointly with the CCLP regularizer, while SupCon employs a
3

--- Page 4 ---
two stage training and discards the contrastive head. Lastly, the scale of experiments in Kamnitsas
et. al. is much smaller than in this work. Merging the ﬁndings of our paper and CCLP is a promising
direction for semi-supervised learning research.

Method
Our method is structurally similar to that used in [48, 3] for self-supervised contrastive learning,
with modiﬁcations for supervised classiﬁcation. Given an input batch of data, we ﬁrst apply data
augmentation twice to obtain two copies of the batch. Both copies are forward propagated through
the encoder network to obtain a 2048-dimensional normalized embedding. During training, this
representation is further propagated through a projection network that is discarded at inference time.
The supervised contrastive loss is computed on the outputs of the projection network. To use the
trained model for classiﬁcation, we train a linear classiﬁer on top of the frozen representations using
a cross-entropy loss. Fig. 1 in the Supplementary material provides a visual explanation.
3.1
Representation Learning Framework
The main components of our framework are:
• Data Augmentation module, Aug(·). For each input sample, x, we generate two random augmen-
tations, ˜x = Aug(x), each of which represents a different view of the data and contains some
subset of the information in the original sample. Sec. 4 gives details of the augmentations.
• Encoder Network, Enc(·), which maps x to a representation vector, r = Enc(x) ∈RDE. Both
augmented samples are separately input to the same encoder, resulting in a pair of representation
vectors. r is normalized to the unit hypersphere in RDE (DE = 2048 in all our experiments in
the paper). Consistent with the ﬁndings of [42, 52], our analysis and experiments show that this
normalization improves top-1 accuracy.
• Projection Network, Proj(·), which maps r to a vector z = Proj(r) ∈RDP . We instantiate
Proj(·) as either a multi-layer perceptron [14] with a single hidden layer of size 2048 and output
vector of size DP = 128 or just a single linear layer of size DP = 128; we leave to future work
the investigation of optimal Proj(·) architectures. We again normalize the output of this network
to lie on the unit hypersphere, which enables using an inner product to measure distances in the
projection space. As in self-supervised contrastive learning [48, 3], we discard Proj(·) at the end
of contrastive training. As a result, our inference-time models contain exactly the same number of
parameters as a cross-entropy model using the same encoder, Enc(·).
3.2
Contrastive Loss Functions
Given this framework, we now look at the family of contrastive losses, starting from the self-
supervised domain and analyzing the options for adapting it to the supervised domain, showing that
one formulation is superior. For a set of N randomly sampled sample/label pairs, {xk, yk}k=1...N,
the corresponding batch used for training consists of 2N pairs, {˜xℓ, ˜yℓ}ℓ=1...2N, where ˜x2k and
˜x2k−1 are two random augmentations (a.k.a., “views”) of xk (k = 1...N) and ˜y2k−1 = ˜y2k = yk.
For the remainder of this paper, we will refer to a set of N samples as a “batch” and the set of 2N
augmented samples as a “multiviewed batch”.
3.2.1
Self-Supervised Contrastive Loss
Within a multiviewed batch, let i ∈I ≡{1...2N} be the index of an arbitrary augmented sample,
and let j(i) be the index of the other augmented sample originating from the same source sample.
In self-supervised contrastive learning (e.g., [3, 48, 18, 22]), the loss takes the following form.

Here, zℓ= Proj(Enc(˜xℓ)) ∈RDP , the • symbol denotes the inner (dot) product, τ ∈R+ is a
scalar temperature parameter, and A(i) ≡I \ {i}. The index i is called the anchor, index j(i) is
called the positive, and the other 2(N −1) indices ({k ∈A(i) \ {j(i)}) are called the negatives.

Note that for each anchor i, there is 1 positive pair and 2N −2 negative pairs. The denominator has
a total of 2N −1 terms (the positive and negatives).
3.2.2
Supervised Contrastive Losses
For supervised learning, the contrastive loss in Eq. 1 is incapable of handling the case where, due to
the presence of labels, more than one sample is known to belong to the same class. Generalization
to an arbitrary numbers of positives, though, leads to a choice between multiple possible functions.
Eqs. 2 and 3 present the two most straightforward ways to generalize Eq. 1 to incorporate supervi-
sion.

Here, P(i) ≡{p ∈A(i) : ˜yp = ˜yi} is the set of indices of all positives in the multiviewed batch
distinct from i, and |P(i)| is its cardinality. In Eq. 2, the summation over positives is located outside
of the log (Lsup
out) while in Eq. 3, the summation is located inside of the log (Lsup
in ). Both losses have
the following desirable properties:
• Generalization to an arbitrary number of positives. The major structural change of Eqs. 2
and 3 over Eq. 1 is that now, for any anchor, all positives in a multiviewed batch (i.e., the
augmentation-based sample as well as any of the remaining samples with the same label) con-
tribute to the numerator. For randomly-generated batches whose size is large with respect to the
number of classes, multiple additional terms will be present (on average, N/C, where C is the
number of classes). The supervised losses encourage the encoder to give closely aligned represen-
tations to all entries from the same class, resulting in a more robust clustering of the representation
space than that generated from Eq. 1, as is supported by our experiments in Sec. 4.
• Contrastive power increases with more negatives. Eqs. 2 and 3 both preserve the summation
over negatives in the contrastive denominator of Eq. 1. This form is largely motivated by noise
contrastive estimation and N-pair losses [13, 45], wherein the ability to discriminate between
signal and noise (negatives) is improved by adding more examples of negatives. This property is
important for representation learning via self-supervised contrastive learning, with many papers
showing increased performance with increasing number of negatives [18, 15, 48, 3].
• Intrinsic ability to perform hard positive/negative mining. When used with normalized rep-
resentations, the loss in Eq. 1 induces a gradient structure that gives rise to implicit hard posi-
tive/negative mining. The gradient contributions from hard positives/negatives (i.e., ones against
which continuing to contrast the anchor greatly beneﬁts the encoder) are large while those for easy
positives/negatives (i.e., ones against which continuing to contrast the anchor only weakly beneﬁts
the encoder) are small. Furthermore, for hard positives, the effect increases (asymptotically) as
the number of negatives does. Eqs. 2 and 3 both preserve this useful property and generalize it
to all positives. This implicit property allows the contrastive loss to sidestep the need for explicit
hard mining, which is a delicate but critical part of many losses, such as triplet loss [42]. We note
that this implicit property applies to both supervised and self-supervised contrastive losses, but our
derivation is the ﬁrst to clearly show this property. We provide a full derivation of this property
from the loss gradient in the Supplementary material.

The two loss formulations are not, however, equivalent. Be-

plies that Lsup

the superior supervised loss function (since it upper-bounds

Lsup

in for different batch sizes (N) on the ResNet-50
[17] architecture. The Lsup

cantly higher performance than Lsup
in . We conjecture that this is due to the gradient of Lsup
in
having
5

--- Page 6 ---
structure less optimal for training than that of Lsup
out. For Lsup
out, the positives normalization factor
(i.e., 1/|P(i)|) serves to remove bias present in the positives in a multiviewed batch contributing to
the loss. However, though Lsup
in
also contains the same normalization factor, it is located inside of
the log. It thus contributes only an additive constant to the overall loss, which does not affect the
gradient. Without any normalization effects, the gradients of Lsup
in
are more susceptible to bias in
the positives, leading to sub-optimal training.
An analysis of the gradients themselves supports this conclusion. As shown in the Supplementary,
the gradient for either Lsup

Connection to Triplet Loss and N-pairs Loss
Supervised contrastive learning is closely related to the triplet loss [53], one of the widely-used loss
functions for supervised learning. In the Supplementary, we show that the triplet loss is a special
case of the contrastive loss when one positive and one negative are used. When more than one
negative is used, we show that the SupCon loss becomes equivalent to the N-pairs loss [45].

Experiments
We evaluate our SupCon loss (Lsup
out, Eq. 2) by measuring classiﬁcation accuracy on a number
of common image classiﬁcation benchmarks including CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 [27] and Ima-
geNet [7]. We also benchmark our ImageNet models on robustness to common image corruptions
[19] and show how performance varies with changes to hyperparameters and reduced data. For
the encoder network (Enc(·)) we experimented with three commonly used encoder architectures:
ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-200 [17]. The normalized activations of the ﬁnal pooling
layer (DE = 2048) are used as the representation vector. We experimented with four different
implementations of the Aug(·) data augmentation module: AutoAugment [5]; RandAugment [6];
SimAugment [3], and Stacked RandAugment [49] (see details of our SimAugment and Stacked
RandAugment implementations in the Supplementary). AutoAugment outperforms all other data
augmentation strategies on ResNet-50 for both SupCon and cross-entropy. Stacked RandAugment
performed best for ResNet-200 for both loss functions. We provide more details in the Supplemen-
tary.

Classiﬁcation Accuracy
Table 2 shows that SupCon generalizes better than cross-entropy, margin classiﬁers (with use of
labels) and unsupervised contrastive learning techniques on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet
datasets. Table 3 shows results for ResNet-50 and ResNet-200 (we use ResNet-v1 [17]) for Ima-
geNet. We achieve a new state of the art accuracy of 78.7% on ResNet-50 with AutoAugment (for

comparison, a number of the other top-performing methods are shown in Fig. 1). Note that we also
achieve a slight improvement over CutMix [60], which is considered to be a state of the art data
augmentation strategy. Incorporating data augmentation strategies such as CutMix [60] and MixUp
[61] into contrastive learning could potentially improve results further.
We also experimented with memory based alternatives [15]. On ImageNet, with a memory size
of 8192 (requiring only the storage of 128-dimensional vectors), a batch size of 256, and SGD
optimizer, running on 8 Nvidia V100 GPUs, SupCon is able to achieve 79.1% top-1 accuracy on
ResNet-50. This is in fact slightly better than the 78.7% accuracy with 6144 batch size (and no
memory); and with signiﬁcantly reduced compute and memory footprint.
Since SupCon uses 2 views per sample, its batch sizes are effectively twice the cross-entropy equiv-
alent. We therefore also experimented with the cross-entropy ResNet-50 baselines using a batch size
of 12,288. These only achieved 77.5% top-1 accuracy. We additionally experimented with increas-
ing the number of training epochs for cross-entropy all the way to 1400, but this actually decreased
accuracy (77.0%).
We tested the N-pairs loss [45] in our framework with a batch size of 6144. N-pairs achieves only
57.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. We believe this is due to multiple factors missing from N-pairs
loss compared to supervised contrastive: the use of multiple views; lower temperature; and many
more positives. We show some results of the impact of the number of positives per anchor in the
Supplementary (Sec. 6), and the N-pairs result is inline with them. We also note that the original
N-pairs paper [45] has already shown the outperformance of N-pairs loss to triplet loss.

Robustness to Image Corruptions and Reduced Training Data
Deep neural networks lack robustness to out of distribution data or natural corruptions such as noise,
blur and JPEG compression. The benchmark ImageNet-C dataset [19] is used to measure trained
model performance on such corruptions. In Fig. 3(left), we compare the supervised contrastive
models to cross-entropy using the Mean Corruption Error (mCE) and Relative Mean Corruption Er-
ror metrics [19]. Both metrics measure average degradation in performance compared to ImageNet
test set, averaged over all possible corruptions and severity levels. Relative mCE is a better metric
when we compare models with different Top-1 accuracy, while mCE is a better measure of absolute
robustness to corruptions. The SupCon models have lower mCE values across different corruptions,

showing increased robustness. We also see from Fig. 3(right) that SupCon models demonstrate
lesser degradation in accuracy with increasing corruption severity.
4.3
Hyperparameter Stability
We experimented with hyperparameter stability by changing augmentations, optimizers and learning
rates one at a time from the best combination for each of the methodologies. In Fig. 4(a), we
compare the top-1 accuracy of SupCon loss against cross-entropy across changes in augmentations
(RandAugment [6], AutoAugment [5], SimAugment [3], Stacked RandAugment [49]); optimizers
(LARS, SGD with Momentum and RMSProp); and learning rates. We observe signiﬁcantly lower
variance in the output of the contrastive loss. Note that batch sizes for cross-entropy and supervised
contrastive are the same, thus ruling out any batch-size effects. In Fig. 4(b), sweeping batch size
and holding all other hyperparameters constant results in consistently better top-1 accuracy of the
supervised contrastive loss.
4.4
Transfer Learning
We evaluate the learned representation for ﬁne-tuning on 12 natural image datasets, following the
protocol in Chen et.al. [3]. SupCon is on par with cross-entropy and self-supervised contrastive loss
on transfer learning performance when trained on the same architecture (Table 4). Our results are
consistent with the ﬁndings in [16] and [26]: while better ImageNet models are correlated with better
transfer performance, the dominant factor is architecture. Understanding the connection between
training objective and transfer performance is left to future work.

4.5
Training Details
The SupCon loss was trained for 700 epochs during pretraining for ResNet-200 and 350 epochs for
smaller models. Fig. 4(c) shows accuracy as a function of SupCon training epochs for a ResNet50,
demonstrating that even 200 epochs is likely sufﬁcient for most purposes.
An (optional) additional step of training a linear classiﬁer is used to compute top-1 accuracy. This is
not needed if the purpose is to use representations for transfer learning tasks or retrieval. The second
stage needs as few as 10 epochs of additional training. Note that in practice the linear classiﬁer
can be trained jointly with the encoder and projection networks by blocking gradient propagation
from the linear classiﬁer back to the encoder, and achieve roughly the same results without requiring
two-stage training. We chose not to do that here to help isolate the effects of the SupCon loss.
We trained our models with batch sizes of up to 6144, although batch sizes of 2048 sufﬁce for most
purposes for both SupCon and cross-entropy losses (as shown in Fig. 4(b)). We associate some of
the performance increase with batch size to the effect on the gradient due to hard positives increasing
with an increasing number of negatives (see the Supplementary for details). We report metrics for
experiments with batch size 6144 for ResNet-50 and batch size 4096 for ResNet-200 (due to the
larger network size, a smaller batch size is necessary). We observed that for a ﬁxed batch size it was
possible to train with SupCon using larger learning rates than what was required by cross-entropy to
achieve similar performance.
All our results used a temperature of τ = 0.1. Smaller temperature beneﬁts training more than
higher ones, but extremely low temperatures are harder to train due to numerical instability. Fig.
4(d) shows the effect of temperature on Top-1 performance of supervised contrastive learning. As
we can see from Eq. 4, the gradient scales inversely with choice of temperature τ; therefore we
rescale the loss by τ during training for stability.
We experimented with standard optimizers such as LARS [59], RMSProp [20] and SGD
with momentum [39] in different permutations for the initial pre-training step and train-
ing of the dense layer.
While SGD with momentum works best for training ResNets with
cross-entropy, we get the best performance for SupCon on ImageNet by using LARS for
pre-training and RMSProp to training the linear layer.
For CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 SGD
with momentum performed best.
Additional results for combinations of optimizers are
provided in the Supplementary.

Training Setup
In Fig. 5, we compare the training setup for the cross-entropy, self-supervised contrastive and su-
pervised contrastive (SupCon) losses. Note that the number of parameters in the inference models
always stays the same. We also note that it is not necessary to train a linear classiﬁer in the second
stage, and previous works have used k-Nearest Neighbor classiﬁcation [55] or prototype classiﬁ-
cation to evaluate representations on classiﬁcation tasks. The linear classiﬁer can also be trained
jointly with the encoder, as long as it doesn’t propagate gradients back to the encoder.

Figure 5: Cross entropy, self-supervised contrastive loss and supervised contrastive loss: The cross entropy
loss (left) uses labels and a softmax loss to train a classiﬁer; the self-supervised contrastive loss (middle) uses
a contrastive loss and data augmentations to learn representations. The supervised contrastive loss (right) also
learns representations using a contrastive loss, but uses label information to sample positives in addition to
augmentations of the same image. Both contrastive methods can have an optional second stage which trains a
model on top of the learned representations.

Gradient Derivation
In Sec. 3 of the paper, we make the claim that the gradients of the two considered supervised
contrastive losses, Lsup
out and Lsup
in , with respect to a normalized projection network representation,
zi, have a nearly identical mathematical form. In this section, we perform derivations to show this is
true. It is sufﬁcient to show that this claim is true for Lsup
out,i and Lsup
in,i. For convenience, we reprint
below the expressions for each.

Intrinsic Hard Positive and Negative Mining Properties
The contrastive loss is structured so that gradients with respect to the unnormalized projection net-
work representations provide an intrinsic mechanism for hard positive/negative mining during train-
ing. For losses such as the triplet loss or max-margin, hard mining is known to be crucial to their
performance. For contrastive loss, we show analytically that hard mining is intrinsic and thus re-
moves the need for complicated hard mining algorithms.
As shown in Sec. 6, the gradients of both Lsup
out and Lsup
in
are given by Eq. 12. Additionally, note
that the self-supervised contrastive loss, Lself
i
, is a special case of either of the two supervised
contrastive losses (when P(i) = j(i)). So by showing that Eq. 12 has structure that provides hard
15

--- Page 16 ---
positive/negative mining, it will be shown to be true for all three contrastive losses (self-supervised
and both supervised versions).
The projection network applies a normalization to its outputs4. We shall let wi denote the projection
network output prior to normalization, i.e., zi = wi/∥wi∥. As we show below, normalizing the
representations provides structure (when combined with Eq. 12) to the gradient enables the learning
to focus on hard positives and negatives. The gradient of the supervised loss with respect to wi is
related to that with respect to zi via the chain rule:
∂Lsup
i
(zi)
∂wi
= ∂zi
∂wi
∂Lsup

We now show that easy positives and negatives have small gradient contributions while hard pos-
itives and negatives have large ones. For an easy positive (i.e., one against which contrasting the
anchor only weakly beneﬁts the encoder), zi • zp ≈1. Thus (see Eq. 19):
∥(zp −(zi • zp)zi∥=
q
1 −(zi • zp)2 ≈0
(21)
However, for a hard positive (i.e., one against which contrasting the anchor greatly beneﬁts the
encoder), zi • zp ≈0, so:
∥(zp −(zi • zp)zi∥=
q
1 −(zi • zp)2 ≈1
(22)
4Note that when the normalization is combined with an inner product (as we do here), this is equivalent
to cosine similarity. Some contrastive learning approaches [3] use a cosine similarity explicitly in their loss
formulation. We decouple the normalization here to highlight the beneﬁts it provides.

where P
n∈N(i) exp(zi•zn/τ) ≥0 (assuming zi•zn ≤0) and P
p′∈P (i) exp(zi•zp′/τ)−|P(i)| ≥0
(assuming zi • zp′ ≥0). We thus see that for either Lsup
out and Lsup
in
the gradient response to a hard
positive in any individual training step can be made larger by increasing the number of negatives.
Additionally, for Lsup
out, it can also be made larger by increasing the number of positives.
Thus, for weak positives (since zi • zp ≈1) the contribution to the gradient is small while for hard
positives the contribution is large (since zi •zp ≈0). Similarly, analysing Eq. 20 for weak negatives
(zi • zn ≈−1) vs hard negatives (zi • zn ≈0) we conclude that the gradient contribution is large
for hard negatives and small for weak negatives.
In addition to an increased number of positives/negatives helping in general, we also note that
as we increase the batch size, we also increase the probability of choosing individual hard posi-
tives/negatives. Since hard positives/negatives lead to a larger gradient contribution, we see that a
larger batch has multiple high impact effects to allow obtaining better performance, as we observe
empirically in the main paper.
Additionally, it should be noted that the ability of contrastive losses to perform intrinsic hard pos-
itive/negative data mining comes about only if a normalization layer is added to the end of the
projection network, thereby justifying the use of a normalization in the network. Ours is the ﬁrst
paper to show analytically this property of contrastive losses, even though normalization has been
empirically found to be useful in self-supervised contrastive learning.
8
Triplet Loss Derivation from Contrastive Loss
In this section, we show that the triplet loss [53] is a special case of the contrastive loss when the
number of positives and negatives are each one. Assuming the representation of the anchor (i) and
the positive (p) are more aligned than that of the anchor and negative (n) (i.e., zi • zp ≫zi • zn),
17

--- Page 18 ---
we have:
Lself
=
−log
exp (za • zp/τ)
exp (za • zp/τ) + exp (za • zn/τ)
=
log (1 + exp ((za • zn −za • zp) /τ))
≈
exp ((za • zn −za • zp) /τ)
(Taylor expansion of log)
≈
1 + 1
τ · (za • zn −za • zp)
=
1 −1
2τ ·

∥za −zn∥2 −∥za −zp∥2
∝
∥za −zp∥2 −∥za −zn∥2 + 2τ
which has the same form as a triplet loss with margin α = 2τ. This result is consistent with empirical
results [3] which show that contrastive loss performs better in general than triplet loss on represen-
tation tasks. Additionally, whereas triplet loss in practice requires computationally expensive hard
negative mining (e.g., [42]), the discussion in Sec. 7 shows that the gradients of the supervised con-
trastive loss naturally impose a measure of hard negative reinforcement during training. This comes
at the cost of requiring large batch sizes to include many positives and negatives.
9
Supervised Contrastive Loss Hierarchy
The SupCon loss subsumes multiple other commonly used losses as special cases of itself. It is
insightful to study which additional restrictions need to be imposed on it to change its form into that
of each of these other losses.
For convenience, we reprint the form of the SupCon loss.

|P(i)|
X
p∈P (i)
log
exp (zi • zp/τ)
P
a∈A(i)
exp (zi • za/τ)
(25)
Here, P(i) is the set of all positives in the multiviewed batch corresponding to the anchor i. For
SupCon, positives can come from two disjoint categories:
• Views of the same sample image which generated the anchor image.
• Views of a sample image different from that which generated the anchor image but having
the same label as that of the anchor.
The loss for self-supervised contrastive learning (Eq. 1 in the paper) is a special case of SupCon
when P(i) is restricted to contain only a view of the same source image as that of the anchor (i.e.,
the ﬁrst category above). In this case, P(i) = j(i), where j(i) is the index of view, and Eq. 25
readily takes on the self-supervised contrastive loss form.

(26)
A second commonly referenced loss subsumed by SupCon is the N-Pairs loss [45]. This loss, while
functionally similar to Eq. 26, differs from it by requiring that the positive be generated from a
sample image different from that which generated the anchor but which has the same label as the
anchor (i.e., the second category above). There is also no notion of temperature in the original
N-Pairs loss, though it could be easily generalized to include it. Letting k(i) denote the positive
originating from a different sample image than that which generated the anchor i, the N-Pairs loss
has the following form:
Lsup|P (i)=k(i),τ=1 = Ln-pairs = −

exp
 zi • zk(i)

P
a∈A(i)
exp (zi • za)
(27)
18

--- Page 19 ---
It is interesting to see how these constraints affect performance. For a batch size of 6144, a ResNet-
50 encoder trained on ImageNet with N-Pairs loss achieves an ImageNet Top-1 classiﬁcation accu-
racy of 57.4% while an identical setup trained with the SupCon loss achieves 78.7%.
Finally, as discussed in Sec. 8, triplet loss is a special case of the SupCon loss (as well as that of
the self-supervised and N-Pairs losses) when the number of positives and negatives are restricted to
both be one.
10
Effect of Temperature in Loss Function
Similar to previous work [3, 48], we ﬁnd that the temperature τ used in the loss function has an
important role to play in supervised contrastive learning and that the model trained with the optimal
temperature can improve performance by nearly 3%. Two competing effects that changing the
temperature has on training the model are:
1. Smoothness: The distances in the representation space used for training the model have
gradients with smaller norm (||∇L|| ∝
1
τ ); see Section 6. Smaller magnitude gradients
make the optimization problem simpler by allowing for larger learning rates. In Section
3.3 of the paper, it is shown that in the case of a single positive and negative, the contrastive
loss is equivalent to a triplet loss with margin ∝τ. Therefore, in these cases, a larger
temperature makes the optimization easier, and classes more separated.
2. Hard positives/negatives: On the other hand, as shown in Sec 7, the supervised contrastive
loss has structure that cause hard positives/negatives to improve performance. Addition-
ally, hard negatives have been shown to improve classiﬁcation accuracy when models are
trained with the triplet loss [42]. Low temperatures are equivalent to optimizing for hard
positives/negatives: for a given batch of samples and a speciﬁc anchor, lowering the tem-
perature relatively increases the value of Pik (see Eq. 10) for samples which have larger
inner product with the anchor, and reduces it for samples which have smaller inner product.
We found empirically that a temperature of 0.1 was optimal for top-1 accuracy on ResNet-50; results
on various temperatures are shown in Fig. 4 of the main paper. We use the same temperature for all
experiments on ResNet-200.

Table 5: Comparison of Top-1 accuracy variability as
a function of the maximum number of positives |P(i)|
varies from 1 to no cap . Adding more positives bene-
ﬁts the ﬁnal Top-1 accuracy. Note that with 1 positive,
this is equivalent to the self-supervised approach of [3]
where the positive is an augmented version of the same
sample.
We run ablations to test the effect of the num-
ber of positives. Speciﬁcally, we take at most
k positives for each sample, and also remove
them from the denominator of the loss func-
tion so they are not considered as a negative.
We train with a batch size of 6144, so with-
out this capping there are 13 positives in expec-
tation(6 positives, each with 2 augmentatioins,
plus other augmentation of anchor image). We
train for 350 epochs. Table 5 shows the steady beneﬁt of adding more positives for a ResNet-50
model trained on ImageNet with supervised contrastive loss. Note that for each anchor, the number
of positives always contains one positive which is the same sample but with a different data aug-
mentation; and the remainder of the positives are different samples from the same class. Under this
deﬁnition, self-supervised learning is considered as having 1 positive.
12
Robustness
Along with measuring the mean Corruption Error (mCE) and mean relative Corruption Error [19]
on the ImageNet-C dataset (see paper, Section 4.2 and Figure 3), we also measure the Expected
Calibration Error and the mean accuracy of our models on different corruption severity levels. Table
6 demonstrates how performance and calibration degrades as the data shifts farther from the training
distribution and becomes harder to classify. Figure 6 shows how the calibration error of the model

unlike the cross entropy loss.
increases as the level of corruption severity increases as measured by performance on ImageNet-C
[19].

13
Two stage training on Cross Entropy
To ablate the effect of representation learning and have a two stage evaluation process we also
compared against using models trained with cross-entropy loss for representation learning. We
do this by ﬁrst training the model with cross entropy and then re-initializing the ﬁnal layer of the
network randomly. In this second stage of training we again train with cross entropy but keep the
weights of the network ﬁxed. Table 7 shows that the representations learnt by cross-entropy for a
ResNet-50 network are not robust and just the re-initialization of the last layer leads to large drop in
accuracy and a mixed result on robustness compared to a single-stage cross-entropy training. Hence
both methods of training cross-entropy are inferior to supervised contrastive loss.

Optimizer
We experiment with various optimizers for the contrastive learning and training the linear classiﬁer
in various combinations. We present our results in Table 8. The LARS optimizer [59] gives us the
best results to train the embedding network, conﬁrming what has been reported by previous work
[3]. With LARS we use a cosine learning rate decay. On the other hand we ﬁnd that the RMSProp
optimizer [50] works best for training the linear classiﬁer. For RMSProp we use an exponential
decay for the learning rate.

Data Augmentation
We experiment with the following data augmentations:
• AutoAugment: [5] A two stage augmentation policy which is trained with reinforcement
learning for Top-1 Accuracy on ImageNet.
• RandAugment: [6] A two stage augmentation policy that uses a random parameter in place
of parameters tuned by AutoAugment. This parameter needs to be tuned and hence reduces
the search space, while giving better results than AutoAugment.
• SimAugment: [3] An augmentation policy which applies random ﬂips, rotations, color
jitters followed by Gaussian blur. We also add an additional step where we warping the
image before the Gaussian blur, which gives a further boost in performance.
• Stacked RandAugment: [49] An augmentation policy which is based on RandAugment
[6] and SimAugment [3]. The strategy involves an additional RandAugment step before
doing the color jitter as done in SimAugment. This leads to a more diverse set of images
created by the augmentation and hence more robust training which generalizes better.
and found that AutoAugment [30] gave us the highest Top-1 accuracy on ResNet-50 for both the
cross entropy loss and supervised contrastive loss. On the other hand Stacked RandAugment [49]
gives us highest Top-1 accuracy on ResNet-200 for both the cross entropy loss and supervised con-
trastive Loss. We conjecture this is happens because Stacked RandAugment is a stronger augmen-
tation strategy and hence needs a larger model capacity to generalize well.

We also note that AutoAugment is faster at runtime than other augmentation schemes such as Ran-
dAugment [6], SimAugment [3] or StackedRandAugment [49] and hence models trained with Au-
toAugment take lesser time to train. We leave experimenting with MixUp [61] or CutMix [60] as
future work.

Table 9: Combinations of different data augmentations for ResNet-50 trained with optimal set of hyper-
parameters and optimizers. We observe that stacked RandAugment does consistently worse for all conﬁgu-
rations due to lower capacity of ResNet-50 models. We also observe that for other augmentations that we get
the best performance by using the same augmentations in both stages of training.
Further we experiment with varying levels of augmentation magnitude for RandAugment since that
has shown to affect performance when training models with cross entropy loss [6]. Fig. 7 shows
that supervised contrastive methods consistently outperform cross entropy training independent of
augmentation magnitude.
Figure 7: Top-1 Accuracy vs RandAugment magnitude for ResNet-50 (left) and ResNet-200 (right). We see that
supervised contrastive methods consistently outperform cross entropy for varying strengths of augmentation.
