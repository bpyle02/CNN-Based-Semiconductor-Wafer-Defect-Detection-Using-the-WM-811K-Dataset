Abstract
We design a family of image classiﬁcation architectures
that optimize the trade-off between accuracy and efﬁ-
ciency in a high-speed regime.
Our work exploits re-
cent ﬁndings in attention-based architectures, which are
competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We
revisit principles from the extensive literature on convo-
lutional neural networks to apply them to transformers,
in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions.
We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to inte-
grate positional information in vision transformers.
As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network
for fast inference image classiﬁcation. We consider dif-
ferent measures of efﬁciency on different hardware plat-
forms, so as to best reﬂect a wide range of application
scenarios.
Our extensive experiments empirically vali-
date our technical choices and show they are suitable to
most architectures. Overall, LeViT signiﬁcantly outper-
forms existing convnets and vision transformers with re-
spect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80%
ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than
EfﬁcientNet on CPU. We release the code at https:

Introduction
Transformer neural networks were initially introduced for
Natural Language Processing applications [1]. They now
dominate in most applications of this ﬁeld. They manipu-
late variable-size sequences of token embeddings that are
fed to a residual architecture. The model comprises two
sorts for residual blocks: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
and an original type of layer: the self-attention, which al-
lows all pairs of tokens in the input to be combined via a

bilinear function. This is in contrast to 1D convolutional
approaches that are limited to a ﬁxed-size neighborhood.
Recently, the vision transformer (ViT) architecture [2]
obtained state-of-the-art results for image classiﬁcation
in the speed-accuracy tradeoff with pre-training on large
scale dataset. The Data-efﬁcient Image Transformer [3]
obtains competitive performance when training the ViT
models only on ImageNet [4]. It also introduces smaller
models adapted for high-throughput inference.
In this paper, we explore the design space to offer even
better trade-offs than ViT/DeiT models in the regime of
small and medium-sized architectures. We are especially
interested in optimizing the performance–accuracy trade-
off, such as the throughput (images/second) performance
depicted in Figure 1 for Imagenet-1k-val [5].

While many works [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] aim at reducing the
memory footprint of classiﬁers and feature extractors, in-
ference speed is equally important, with high throughput
corresponding to better energy efﬁciency. In this work,
our goal is to develop a Vision Transformer-based fam-
ily of models with better inference speed on both highly-
parallel architectures like GPU, regular Intel CPUs, and
ARM hardware commonly found in mobile devices. Our
solution re-introduces convolutional components in place
of transformer components that learn convolutional-like
features. In particular, we replace the uniform structure
of a Transformer by a pyramid with pooling, similar to
the LeNet [11] architecture. Hence we call it LeViT.
There are compelling reasons why transformers are
faster than convolutional architectures for a given compu-
tational complexity. Most hardware accelerators (GPUs,
TPUs) are optimized to perform large matrix multipli-
cations. In transformers, attention and MLP blocks rely
mainly on these operations. Convolutions, in contrast, re-
quire complex data access patterns, so their operation is
often IO-bound. These considerations are important for
our exploration of the speed/accuracy tradeoff.
The contributions
of this paper are techniques that al-
low ViT models to be shrunk down, both in terms of the
width and spatial resolution:
• A multi-stage transformer architecture using attention
as a downsampling mechanism;
• A computationally efﬁcient patch descriptor that
shrinks the number of features in the ﬁrst layers;
• A learnt, per-head translation-invariant attention bias
that replaces ViT’s positional embeddding;
• A redesigned Attention-MLP block that improves the
network capacity for a given compute time.

Related work
The convolutional networks descended from LeNet [11]
have evolved substantially over time [12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
17]. The most recent families of architectures focus on
ﬁnding a good trade-off between efﬁciency and perfor-
mance [18, 17, 19]. For instance, the EfﬁcientNet [17]
family was discovered by carefully designing individual
components followed by hyper-parameters search under a
FLOPs constraint.
Transformers.
The transformer architecture was ﬁrst
introduced by Vaswani et al. [1] for machine transla-
tion.
Transformer encoders primarily rely on the self-
attention operation in conjunction with feed-forward lay-
ers, providing a strong and explicit method for learning
long range dependencies. Transformers have been subse-
quently adopted for NLP tasks providing state-of-the-art
performance on various benchmarks [20, 21]. There have
been many attempts at adapting the transformer architec-
ture to images [22, 23], ﬁrst by applying them on pixels.
Due to the quadratic computational complexity and num-
ber of parameters involved by attention mechanisms, most
authors [23, 24] initially considered images of small sizes
like in CIFAR or Imagenet64 [25]. Mixed text and im-
age embeddings already use transformers with detection
bounding boxes as input [26], i.e. the bulk of the image
processing is done in the convolutional domain.
The vision transformer (ViT) [2].
Interestingly, this
transformer architecture is very close to the initial NLP
version, devoid of explicit convolutions (just ﬁxed-size
image patch linearized into a vector), yet it competes with
the state of the art for image classiﬁcation. ViT achieves
strong performance when pre-trained on a large labelled
dataset such as the JFT300M (non-public, although train-
ing on Imagenet-21k also produces competitive results).
The need for this pre-training, in addition to strong data
augmentation, can be attributed to the fact that transform-
ers have less built-in structure than convolutions, in partic-
ular they do not have an inductive bias to focus on nearby
image elements. The authors hypothesized that a large
and varied dataset is needed to regularize the training.
In DeiT [3], the need for the large pre-training dataset
is replaced with a student-teacher setup and stronger
data augmentation and regularization, such as stochas-
tic depth [27] or repeated augmentation [28, 29]. The
teacher is a convolutional neural network that “helps” its
student network to acquire an inductive bias for convo-
lutions. The vision transformer has been thereafter suc-
cessfully adopted by a wider range of computer vision
tasks including object detection [30], semantic segmen-
tation [31] and image retrieval [32].
Positional encoding.
Transformers take a set as input,
and hence are invariant to the order of the input. How-
ever, in language as well as in images, the inputs come
from a structure where the order is important. The origi-
2

--- Page 3 ---
nal Transformer [1] incorporates absolute non-parametric
positional encoding with the input.
Other works has
replaced them with parametric encoding [33] or adopt
Fourier-based kernelized versions [22]. Absolute position
encoding enforce a ﬁxed size for the set of inputs, but
some works use relative position encoding [34] that en-
code the relative position between tokens. In our work, we
replace these explicit positional encoding by positional bi-
ases that implicitly encode the spatial information.
Attention along other mechanisms.
Several works
have included attention mechanisms in neural network
architectures designed for vision [35, 36, 37, 38]. The
mechanism is used channel-wise to capture cross-feature
information that complements convolutional layers [39,
40, 41], select paths in different branch of a network [42],
or combine both [43].
For instance, the squeeze-and-
excite network of Hu et al. [44] has an attention-like mod-
ule to model the channel-wise relationships between the
features of a layer. Li et al. [37] use the attention mecha-
nism between branches of the network to adapt the recep-
tive ﬁeld of neurons.
Recently, the emergence of transformers led to hybrid
architectures that beneﬁt from other modules. Bello [45]
proposes an approximated content attention with a posi-
tional attention component. Child et al. [23] observe that
many early layers in the network learn locally connected
patterns, which resemble convolutions. This suggests that
hybrid architectures inspired both by transformers and
convnets are a compelling design choice. A few recent
works explore this avenue for different tasks [46, 47].
In image classiﬁcation, a recent work that comes out
in parallel with ours is the Pyramid Vision Transformer
(PVT) [48], whose design is heavily inspired by ResNet.
It is principally intended to address object and instance
segmentation tasks.
Also concurrently with our work, Yuan et al. [49] pro-
pose the Tokens-to-Tokens ViT (T2T-ViT) model. Simi-
lar to PVT, its design relies on re-tokenization of the out-
put after each layer by aggregating the neighboring tokens
such number of tokens are progressively reduced. Addi-
tionally, Yuan et al. [49] investigate the integration of ar-
chitecture design choices from CNNs [44, 50, 51] that can
improve the performance and efﬁciency of vision trans-
formers. As we will see, these recent methods are not as
much focused as our work on the trade-off between accu-

Motivation
In this section we discuss the seemingly convolutional be-
havior of the transformer patch projection layer. We then
carry out “grafting experiments” of a transformer (DeiT-
S) on a standard convolutional architecture (ResNet-50).
The conclusions drawn by this analysis will motivate our
subsequent design choices in Section 4.
3.1
Convolutions in the ViT architecture
ViT’s patch extractor is a 16x16 convolution with stride
16. Moreover, the output of the patch extractor is mul-
tiplied by learnt weights to form the ﬁrst self-attention
layer’s q, k and v embeddings, so we may consider these
to also be convolutional functions of the input. This is
also the case for variants like DeiT [3] and PVT [48]. In
Figure 2 we visualize the ﬁrst layer of DeiT’s attention
weights, broken down by attention head. This is a more
direct representation than the principal components de-
picted by Dosovitskiy et al. [2]. One can observe the typi-
cal patterns inherent to convolutional architectures: atten-
tion heads specialize in speciﬁc patterns (low-frequency
colors / high frequency graylelvels), and the patterns are

similar to Gabor ﬁlters.
In convolutions where the convolutional masks overlap
signiﬁcantly, the spatial smoothness of the masks comes
from the overlap: nearby pixel receive approximately the
same gradient. For ViT convolutions there is no over-
lap. The smoothness mask is likely caused by the data
augmentation: when an image is presented twice, slightly
translated, the same gradient goes through each ﬁlter, so
it learns this spatial smoothness.
Therefore, in spite of the absence of “inductive bias” in
transformer architectures, the training does produce ﬁlters
that are similar to traditional convolutional layers.
3.2
Preliminary experiment: grafting
The authors of the ViT image classiﬁer [2] experimented
with stacking the transformer layers above a traditional
ResNet-50. In that case, the ResNet acts as a feature ex-
tractor for the transformer layers and the gradients can be
propagated back through the two networks. However, in
their experiments, the number of transformer layers was
ﬁxed (e.g. 12 layers for ViT-Base).
In this subsection, we investigate the potential of mix-
ing transformers with convolutional network under a sim-
ilar computational budget: We explore trade-offs ob-
tained when varying the number of convolutional stages
and transformer layers. Our objective is to evaluate varia-
tions of convolutional and transformer hybrids while con-
trolling for the runtime.
Grafting.
The grafting combines a ResNet-50 and a
DeiT-Small. The two networks have similar runtimes.
We crop the upper stages of the ResNet-50 and like-
wise reduce the number of DeiT layers (while keeping
the same number of transformer and MLP blocks). Since
a cropped ResNet produces larger activation maps than
the 14×14 activations consumed by DeiT, we introduce a
pooling layer between them. In preliminary experiments
we found average pooling to perform best. The positional
embedding and classiﬁcation token are introduced at the
interface between the convolutional and transformer layer
stack. For the ResNet-50 stages, we use ReLU activation
units [52] and batch normalization [53].
Results.
Table 1 summarizes the results. The grafted
architecture produces better results than both DeiT and
ResNet-50 alone. The smallest number of parameters and
best accuracy are with two stages of ResNet-50, because
this excludes the convnet’s large third stage. Note that in
this experiment, the training process is similar to DeiT:
300 epochs, we measure the top-1 validation accuracy on
ImageNet, and the speed as the number of images that one
GPU can process per second.
One interesting observation that we show Figure 3 is
that the convergence of grafted models during training
seems to be similar to a convnet during the early epochs
and then switch to a convergence rate similar to DeiT-S. A
hypothesis is that the convolutional layers have the ability
to learn representations of the low-level information in the
earlier layers more efﬁciently due to their strong inductive
biases, noticeably their translation invariance. They rely
rapidly on meaningful patch embeddings, which can ex-
plain the faster convergence during the ﬁrst epochs.
Discussion.
It appears that in a runtime controlled
regime it is beneﬁcial to insert convolutional stages be-
low a transformer. Most of the processing is still done in
the transformer stack for the most accurate variants of the
grafted architecture. Thus, the priority in the next sections
will be to reduce the computational cost of the transform-
ers. For this, instead of just grafting, the transformer ar-
chitecture needs to be merged more closely with the con-
volutional stages.

Model
In this section we describe the design process of the
LeViT architecture and what tradeoffs were taken. The
architecture is summarized in Figure 4.
4.1
Design principles of LeViT
LeViT builds upon the ViT [2] architecture and DeiT [3]
training method. We incorporate components that were
proven useful for convolutional architectures. The ﬁrst
step is to get a compatible representation. Discounting
the role of the classiﬁcation embedding, ViT is a stack
of layers that processes activation maps. Indeed, the in-
termediate “token” embeddings can be seen as the tradi-
tional C × H × W activation maps in FCN architectures
(BCHW format). Therefore, operations that apply to ac-
tivation maps (pooling, convolutions) can be applied to
the intermediate representation of DeiT.
In this work we optimize the architecture for compute,
not necessarily to minimize the number of parameters.
One of the design decisions that makes the ResNet [14]
family more efﬁcient than the VGG network [13] is to
apply strong resolution reductions with a relatively small
computation budget in its ﬁrst two stages. By the time
the activation map reaches the big third stage of ResNet,
its resolution has already shrunk enough that the convolu-
tions are applied to small activation maps, which reduces
the computational cost.

Patch embedding.
The preliminary analysis in Sec-
tion 3 showed that the accuracy can be improved when a
small convnet is applied on input to the transformer stack.

In LeViT we chose to apply 4 layers of 3×3 convolutions
(stride 2) to the input to perform the resolution reduction.
The number of channels goes C = 3, 32, 64, 128, 256.
This reduces the activation map input to the lower layers
of the transformer without losing salient information. The
patch extractor for LeViT-256 transforms the image shape
(3, 224, 224) into (256, 14, 14) with 184 MFLOPs. For
comparison, the ﬁrst 10 layers of a ResNet-18 perform
the same dimensionality reduction with 1042 MFLOPs.
No classiﬁcation token.
To use the BCHW tensor for-
mat, we remove the classiﬁcation token. Similar to convo-
lutional networks, we replace it by average pooling on the
last activation map, which produces an embedding used
in the classiﬁer. For distillation during training, we train
separate heads for the classiﬁcation and distillation tasks.
At test time, we average the output from the two heads. In
practice, LeViT can be implemented using either BNC or
BCHW tensor format, whichever is more efﬁcient.
Normalization layers and activations.
The FC layers
in the ViT architecture are equivalent to 1 × 1 convolu-
tions. The ViT uses layer normalization before each at-
tention and MLP unit. For LeViT, each convolution is
followed by a batch normalization. Following [54], each
batch normalization weight parameter that joins up with a
residual connection is initialized to zero. The batch nor-
malization can be merged with the preceding convolution
for inference, which is a runtime advantage over layer
normalization (for example, on EfﬁcientNet B0, this fu-
sion speeds up inference on GPU by a factor 2). Whereas
DeiT uses the GELU function, all of LeViT’s non-linear
activations are Hardswish [19].
Multi-resolution
pyramid.
Convolutional
architec-
tures are built as pyramids, where the resolution of the
activation maps decreases as their number of channels
increases during processing. In Section 3 we used the
ResNet-50 stages to pre-process the transformer stack.
LeViT integrates the ResNet stages within the trans-
former architecture. Inside the stages, the architecture is
similar to a visual transformer: a residual structure with
alternated MLP and activation blocks. In the following we
review the modiﬁcations of the attention blocks (Figure 5)
compared to the classical setup [1].
Downsampling.
Between the LeViT stages, a shrink-
ing attention block reduces the size of the activation map:
a subsampling is applied before the Q transformation,
which then propagates to the output of the soft activation.
This maps an input tensor of size (C, H, W) to an out-
put tensor of size (C′, H/2, W/2) with C′ > C. Due to
the change in scale, this attention block is used without a
residual connection. To prevent loss of information, we
take the number of attention heads to be C/D.
Attention bias instead of a positional embedding.
The positional embedding in transformer architectures is
a location-dependent trainable parameter vector that is
added to the token embeddings prior to inputting them to
the transformer blocks. If it was not there, the transformer
output would be independent to permutations of the input
tokens. Ablations of the positional embedding result in a
sharp drop of the classiﬁcation accuracy [55].
However positional embeddings are included only on
input to the sequence of attention blocks. Therefore, since
the positional encoding is important for higher layers as
well, it is likely that it remains in the intermediate repre-
sentations and needlessly uses representation capacity.
Therefore, our goal is to provide positional informa-
tion within each attention block, and to explicitly inject
relative position information in the attention mechanism:
we simply add an attention bias to the attention maps.
The scalar attention value between two pixels (x, y) ∈
[H]×[W] and (x′, y′) ∈[H]×[W] for one head h ∈[N]
is calculated as
Ah
(x,y),(x′,y′) = Q(x,y),: •K(x′,y′),: +Bh
|x−x′|,|y−y′|. (1)
The ﬁrst term is the classical attention. The second is the
translation-invariant attention bias. Each head has H ×W
parameters corresponding to different pixel offsets. Sym-
metrizing the differences x−x′ and y −y′ encourages the
model to train with ﬂip invariance.
Smaller keys.
The bias term reduces the pressure on the
keys to encode location information, so we reduce the size
of the keys matrices relative to the V matrix. If the keys
have size D ∈{16, 32}, V will have 2D channels. Re-
stricting the size of the keys reduces the time needed to
calculate the key product QK⊤.
For downsampling layers, where there is no residual
connection, we set the dimension of V to 4D to prevent
loss of information.

tion of the activation map. The input activation map is of
size C × H × W. N is the number of heads, the multipli-
cation operations are performed independently per head.
Attention activation.
We apply a Hardswish activation
to the product AhV before the regular linear projection is
used to combine the output of the different heads. This is
akin to a ResNet bottleneck residual block, in the sense
that V is the output of a 1 × 1 convolution, AhV cor-
responds to a spatial convolution, and the projection is
another 1 × 1 convolution.
Reducing the MLP blocks.
The MLP residual block
in ViT is a linear layer that increases the embedding di-
mension by a factor 4, applies a non-linearity and reduces
it back with another non-linearity to the original embed-
ding’s dimension. For vision architectures, the MLP is
usually more expensive in terms of runtime and parame-
ters than the attention block. For LeViT, the “MLP” is a
1×1 convolution, followed by the usual batch normaliza-
tion. To reduce the computational cost of that phase, we
reduce the expansion factor of the convolution from 4 to
2. One design objective is that attention and MLP blocks
consume approximately the same number of FLOPs.
4.3
The LeViT family of models
The LeViT models can spawn a range of speed-accuracy
tradeoffs by varying the size of the computation stages.
We identify them by the number of channels input to the
ﬁrst transformer, e.g. LeViT-256 has 256 channels on in-
put of the transformer stage. Table 2 shows how the stages
are designed for the models that we evaluate in this paper.

Experiments
5.1
Experimental context
Datasets and evaluation.
We model our experiments
on the DeiT work, that is closest to our approach. It builds
upon PyTorch [56] and the Timm library [57]. We train
on the ImageNet-2012 dataset and evaluate on its valida-
tion set. We do not explore using more training data in
this work.
Resource consumption.
The generally accepted mea-
sure for inference speed is in units of multiply-add opera-
tions (aka FLOPs) because ﬂoating-point matrix multipli-
cations and convolutions can be expressed as those.
However, some operations, most notably non-linear ac-
tivations, do not perform multiply-add operations. They
are generally ignored in the FLOP counts (or counted as
a single FLOP) because it is assumed that their cost is
negligible w.r.t. the cost of higher-order matrix multipli-
cations and convolutions. However, for a small number
of channels, the runtime of complicated activations like
GELU is comparable to that of convolutions. Moreover,
operations with the same number of FLOPs can be more
or less efﬁcient depending on the hardware and API used.
Therefore, we additionally report raw timings on refer-
ence hardware, like recent papers [2, 58]. The efﬁciency
of transformers relies almost exclusively on matrix multi-

Hardware.
In this work, we run all experiments in Py-
Torch, thus we are dependent on the available optimiza-
tions in that API. In an attempt to obtain more objective
timings, we time the inference on three different hardware
platforms, each corresponding to one use case:
• One 16GB NVIDIA Volta GPU (peak performance is
12 TFLOP/s). This is a typical training accelerator.
• An Intel Xeon 6138 CPU at 2.0GHz. This is a typical
server in a datacenter, that performs feature extraction
on streams of incoming images. PyTorch is well op-
timized for this conﬁguration, using MKL and AVX2
instructions (16 vector registers of 256 bits each).
• An ARM Graviton2 CPU (Amazon C6g instance). It
is a good model for the type of processors that mobile
phones and other edge devices are running. The Gravi-
ton2 has 32 cores supporting the NEON vector instruc-
tion set with 32 128-bit vector registers (NEON).

Table 2: LeViT models. Each stage consists of a number of pairs of Attention and MLP blocks. N: number of heads,
C: number of channels, D: output dimension of the Q and K operators. Separating the stages are shrinking attention
blocks whose values of C, C′ are taken from the rows above and below respectively. Drop path with probability p is
applied to each residual connection. The value of N in the stride-2 blocks is C/D to make up for the lack of a residual
connection. Each attention block is followed by an MLP with expansion factor two.
On the GPU we run timings on large image batches
because that corresponds to typical use cases; following
DeiT we use the maximum power-of-two batchsize that
ﬁts in memory. On the CPU platforms, we measure in-
ference time in a single thread, simulating a setting where
several threads process separate streams of input images.
It is difﬁcult to dissociate the impact of the hardware
and software, so we experiment with several ways to op-
timize the network with standard PyTorch tools (the just-
in-time compiler, different optimization proﬁles).
5.2
Training LeViT
We use 32 GPUs that perform the 1000 training epochs
in 3 to 5 days. This is more than the usual schedule for
convolutional networks, but visual transformers require a
long training, for example training DeiT for 1000 epochs
improves by another 2 points of top-1 precision over 300
epochs.
To regularize the training, we use distillation
driven training, similar to DeiT. This means that LeViT is
trained with two classiﬁcation heads with a cross entropy
loss. The ﬁrst head receives supervision from the ground-
truth classes, the second one from a RegNetY-16GF [18]
model trained on ImageNet. In fact, the LeViT training
time is dominated by the teacher’s inference time.
5.3
Speed-accuracy tradeoffs
Table 3 shows the speed-precision tradeoffs that we ob-
tain with LeViT, and a few salient numbers are plotted
in Figure 1. We compare these with two competitive ar-
chitectures from the state of the art: EfﬁcientNet [17] as
a strong convolutional baseline, and likewise DeiT [3] a
strong transformer-only architecture. Both baselines are
trained under to maximize their accuracy. For example,
we compare with DeiT trained during 1000 epochs.
In the range of operating points we consider, the LeViT
architecture largely outperforms both the transformer and
convolutional variants. LeViT-384 is on-par with DeiT-
Small in accuracy but uses half the number of FLOPs.
The gap widens for faster operating points: LeViT-128S
is on-par with DeiT-Tiny and uses 4× fewer FLOPs.
The runtime measurements follow closely these trends.
For example LeViT-192 and LeViT-256 have about the
same accuracies as EfﬁcientNet B2 and B3 but are 5× and
7× faster on CPU, respectively. On the ARM platform,

the ﬂoat32 operations are not as well optimized compared
to Intel. However, the speed-accuracy trade-off remains
in LeViT’s favor.
5.4
Comparison with the state of the art
Table 4 reports results with other transformer based archi-
tectures for comparison with LeViT (Table 3). Since our
approach specializes in the high-throughput regime, we
do not include very large and slow models [61, 62].
We compare in the FLOPs-accuracy tradeoff, since the
other works are very recent and do not necessarily provide
reference models on which we can time the inference. All
Token-to-token ViT [49] variants take around 5× more
FLOPs than LeViT-384 and more parameters for compa-
rable accuracies than LeViT. Bottleneck transformers [46]
and “Visual Transformers” [47] (not to be confused with
ViT) are both generic architectures that can also be used
for detection and object segmentation. Both are about 5×
slower than LeViT-192 at a comparable accuracy. The
same holds for the pyramid vision transformer [48] (not
reported in the table) but its design objectives are differ-
ent. The advantage of LeViT compared to these archi-
tectures is that it beneﬁted from the DeiT-like distillation,
which makes it much more accurate when training on Im-
ageNet alone. Two architecture that comes close to LeViT

are the pooling-based vision transformer (PiT) [59] and
CvT [60], ViT variants with a pyramid structure. PiT, the
most promising one, incorporates many of the optimiza-
tion ingredients for DeiT but is still 1.2× to 2.4× slower
than LeViT.
Alternaltive evaluations.
In Table 3 we evaluate LeViT
on alternative test sets, Imagenet Real [63] and Ima-
genet V2 matched frequency [64]. The two datasets use
the same set of classes and training set as ImageNet.
Imagenet-Real has re-assessed labels with potentially sev-
eral classes per image. Imagenet-V2 (in our case match
frequency) employs a different test set. It is interesting
to measure the performance on both to verify that hyper-
parameters adjustments have not led to overﬁtting to the
validation set of ImageNet. Thus, we measure the classi-
ﬁcation performance on the alternative test sets for mod-
els that have equivalent accuracies on ImageNet valida-
tion. LeViT-256 and EfﬁcientNet B3: the LeViT variant
achieves the same score on -Real, but is slightly worse
(-0.6) on -V2.
LeViT-384 and DeiT-Small: LeViT is
slightly worse on -Real (-0.2) and -V2 (-0.4). Although
in these evaluations LeViT is relatively slightly less accu-
rate, the speed-accuracy trade-offs still hold, compared to
EfﬁcientNet and DeiT.
5.5
Ablations
To evaluate what contributes to the performance of LeViT,
we experiment with the default setting and replace one pa-
rameter at a time. We train the LeViT-128S model, and a
number of variants, to evaluate the design changes relative
to ViT/DeiT. The experiments are run with only 100 train-
ing epochs to magnify the differences and reduce train-
ing time. The conclusions remain for larger models and
longer training schedules. We replace one component at
a time, when the network needs to be reworked, we make
sure the FLOP count remains roughly the same (see Ap-
pendix A.2 for details). Table 5 shows that all changes
degrade the accuracy:
A1– The without pyramid shape ablation makes a straight
stack of attention and MLPs (like DeiT). However, in or-
der to keep the FLOP count similar to the baseline, the
network width is reduced, resulting in a network with a
small number of parameters, resulting in a very low ﬁnal
accuracy. This evidences that the reduction of the reso-
lution in LeViT is the main tool to keep computational
complexity under control.
A2– without PatchConv:
we remove the four pre-
processing convolutions with a single size-16 convolu-
tion. This has little effect on the number of parameters,
but the number of ﬂops is 10% less. The , and has a strong
negative impact on the accuracy. This can be explained
because in a low-capacity regime, the convolutions are an
effective way to compress the 3 · 162 = 768 dimensional
patch input.
A3– In without BatchNorm, we replaces BatchNorm with
preactivated LayerNorm, as used in the ViT/DeiT archi-
tecture.
This slows down the model slightly, as batch
statistics need to be calculated at test time. Removing
the BatchNorm also removes the zero-initialization of the
residual connections, which disrupts training.
A4– Removing the use of hard distillation from a
RegNetY-16GF teacher model reduces performance, as
seen with DeiT.
A5– The without attention bias ablation replaces the atten-
tion bias component with a classical positional embedding
added on input to the transformer stack (like DeiT). Al-
lowing each attention head to learn a separate bias seems
to be useful.
A6– We use DeiT style blocks, i.e. Q,K and V all have di-
mension D = C/N, and the MLP blocks have expansion
factor 4.
A7– LeViT has an extra Hardswish non-linearity added
to the attention, in addition to the softmax non-linearity.
Removing it, the without attention activation ablation de-
10

--- Page 11 ---
grades performance, suggesting that extra non-linearity is
helpful for learning classiﬁcation class boundaries.

Conclusion
This paper introduced LeViT, a transformer architecture
inspired by convolutional approaches. The accuracy of
LeViT stems mainly from the training techniques in DeiT.
Its speed comes from a series of carefully controlled de-
sign choices. Compared to other efﬁcient neural nets used
for feature extraction in datacenters or on mobile phones,
LeViT is 1.5 to 5 times faster at comparable precision.
Thus to the best of our knowledge, it sets a new state of
the art in the trade-off between accuracy and precision in
the high-speed domain. The corresponding PyTorch code
and models is available at https://github.com/
facebookresearch/LeViT.

Appendix
In this appendix, we report more details and results.
Appendix A details the timings of constituent block and
provides more details about our ablation. We provide vi-
sualizations of the attention bias in Appendix B.
A
Detailed analysis
A.1
Block timings
In this section we compare the differences in design be-
tween DeiT and LeViT blocks from the perspective of
a detailed runtime analysis. We measure the runtime of
their constituent parts side-by-side in the supplementary
Table 6. For DeiT-Tiny, we replace the GELU activation
with Hardswish, as otherwise it dominates the runtime.
For DeiT, we consider a block from DeiT-tiny.
For
LeViT, we consider a block from the ﬁrst stage of LeViT-
256. Both operate at resolution 14×14 and have compara-
ble run times, although LeViT is 33% wider (C = 256 vs
C = 192). Note that stage 1 is the most expensive part of
LeViT-256. In stages 2 and 3, the cost is lower due to the
reduction in resolution (see Figure 4 of the main paper).
LeViT spends less time calculating the attention QKT ,
but more time on the subsequent matrix product AV . De-
spite having the larger block width C, LeViT spends less
time on the MLP component as the expansion factor is
halved from four to two.
A.2
More details on our ablation
Here we give additional details of the ablation experi-
ments in Section 5.6 and Table 4 of the main paper.
A1 – without pyramid shape.
We test the effect of the
LeViT pyramid structure, we replace the three stages with
a single stage of depth 11 at resolution 14 × 14. To pre-
serve the FLOP count, we take D = 19, N = 3 and
C = 2ND = 114.
A6 – without wider blocks.
Compared to DeiT, LeViT
blocks are relatively wide given the number of FLOPs,
with smaller keys and MLP expansion factors. To test
this change we modify LeViT-128S to have more tradi-
tional blocks while preserving the number of FLOPs. We

therefore take Q, K, V to all have dimension D = 30,
and C = ND = 120, 180, 240 for the three stages. As in
DeiT, the MLP expansion ratio is 4. In the subsampling
layers we use N = 4C/D = 16, 24, respectively.
B
Visualizations: attention bias
The attention bias maps from Eqn. 1 in the main paper are
just two-dimensional maps. Therefore we can vizualize
them, see Figure 6. They can be read as the amount of
attention between two pixels that are at a certain relative
position. The lowest values of the bias are low enough (-
20) to suppress the attention between the two pixels, since
they are input to a softmax.
We can observe that some heads are quite uniform,
while other heads specialize in nearby pixels (e.g. most
heads of the shrinking attention). Some are clearly direc-
tional, e.g. heads 1 and 4 of Stage 2/block 1 handle the
pixels adjacent vertically and horizontally (respectively).
Head 1 of stage 2, block 4 has a speciﬁc period-2 pattern
that may be due to the fact that its output is fed to a sub-
sampling ﬁlter in the next shrinking attention block.
