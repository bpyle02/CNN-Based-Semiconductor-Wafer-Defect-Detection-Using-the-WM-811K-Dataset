Abstract. Transformers have recently gained signiﬁcant attention in
the computer vision community. However, the lack of scalability of self-
attention mechanisms with respect to image size has limited their wide
adoption in state-of-the-art vision backbones. In this paper we introduce
an eﬃcient and scalable attention model we call multi-axis attention,
which consists of two aspects: blocked local and dilated global atten-
tion. These design choices allow global-local spatial interactions on ar-
bitrary input resolutions with only linear complexity. We also present a
new architectural element by eﬀectively blending our proposed attention
model with convolutions, and accordingly propose a simple hierarchical
vision backbone, dubbed MaxViT, by simply repeating the basic build-
ing block over multiple stages. Notably, MaxViT is able to “see” globally
throughout the entire network, even in earlier, high-resolution stages.
We demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our model on a broad spectrum of
vision tasks. On image classiﬁcation, MaxViT achieves state-of-the-art
performance under various settings: without extra data, MaxViT attains
86.5% ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy; with ImageNet-21K pre-training,
our model achieves 88.7% top-1 accuracy. For downstream tasks, MaxViT
as a backbone delivers favorable performance on object detection as
well as visual aesthetic assessment. We also show that our proposed
model expresses strong generative modeling capability on ImageNet,
demonstrating the superior potential of MaxViT blocks as a universal
vision module. The source code and trained models will be available at

Keywords: Transformer, Image classiﬁcation, Multi-axis attention.

Introduction
Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) have been the dominant architec-
tural design choice for computer vision [29, 48, 75, 76] since AlexNet [48]. Con-
vNets continue to excel on numerous vision problems by going deeper [75],
wider [74,76], adding dense connections [37], eﬃcient separable convolutions [35,
70], atrous convolutions [9], using encoder-decoder frameworks [67], and even in-
troducing modern micro-design components [57]. Meanwhile, as inspired by the
evolution of self-attention models like Transformers [85] in natural language pro-
cessing [20,49,63,100], numerous researchers have started to introduce attention

mechanisms into vision [6, 88]. The Vision Transformer (ViT) [22] is perhaps
the ﬁrst fully Transformer-based architecture for vision, whereby image patches
are simply regarded as sequences of words and a transformer encoder is applied
on these visual tokens. When pre-trained on large-scale datasets [73], ViT can
achieve compelling results on image recognition.
However, it has been observed that without extensive pre-training [22, 81]
ViT underperforms on image recognition. This is due to the strong model ca-
pacity of Transformers, that is imbued with less inductive bias, which leads to
overﬁtting. To properly regularize the model capacity and improve its scalability,
numerous subsequent eﬀorts have studied sparse Transformer models tailored for
vision tasks such as local attention [16, 50, 56, 99]. These methods typically re-
introduce hierarchical architectures to compensate for the loss of non-locality.
The Swin Transformer [56] is one such successful attempt to modify Transform-
ers by applying self-attention on shifted non-overlapping windows. For the ﬁrst
time, this approach outperformed ConvNets on the ImageNet benchmark with
a pure vision Transformer. Despite having more ﬂexibility and generalizability
than the full attention used in ViT, window-based attention has been observed to
have limited model capacity due to the loss of non-locality, and henceforth scales
unfavorably on larger data regimes such as ImageNet-21K and JFT [19]. How-
ever, acquiring global interactions via full-attention at early or high-resolution
stages in a hierarchical network is computationally heavy, as the attention op-
erator requires quadratic complexity. How to eﬃciently incorporate global and
local interactions to balance the model capacity and generalizability under a
computation budget still remains challenging.
In this paper, we present a new type of Transformer module, called multi-axis
self-attention (Max-SA), that capably serves as a basic architecture component

which can perform both local and global spatial interactions in a single block.
Compared to full self-attention, Max-SA enjoys greater ﬂexibility and eﬃciency,
i.e., naturally adaptive to diﬀerent input lengths with linear complexity; in con-
trast to (shifted) window/local attention, Max-SA allows for stronger model
capacity by proposing a global receptive ﬁeld. Moreover, with merely linear com-
plexity, Max-SA can be used as a general stand-alone attention module in any
layer of a network, even in earlier, high-resolution stages.
To demonstrate its eﬀectiveness and universality, we further design a simple
but eﬀective vision backbone called Multi-axis Vision Transformer (MaxViT)
by hierarchically stacking repeated blocks composed of Max-SA and convolu-
tions. While our proposed model belongs to the category of hybrid vision Trans-
formers, MaxViT distinguishes from previous approaches [19,94] in that we strive
for simplicity, by designing a basic block unifying convolution, local, and global
attention, then simply repeating it. Our experiments shows that the MaxViT
signiﬁcantly improves upon state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under all data
regimes for a broad range of visual tasks including classiﬁcation, object detection
and segmentation, image aesthetics assessment, and image generation. Speciﬁ-
cally, as Figure 1 shows, MaxViT outperforms all recent Transformer-based mod-
els in regards to both accuracy vs. FLOPs and accuracy vs. parameter curves.
Our contributions are:
– A generic strong Transformer backbone, MaxViT, that can capture both
local and global spatial interactions throughout every stage of the network.
– A novel stand-alone multi-axis attention module composed of blocked local
and dilated global attention, enjoying global perception in linear complexity.
– We demonstrate large amounts of design choices including number of layers,
layouts, the use of MBConv, etc. with extensive ablation studies, that even-
tually converge towards our ﬁnal modular design, the MaxViT-Block.
– Our extensive experiments show that MaxViT achieves SOTA results under
various data regimes for a broad range of tasks including image classiﬁcation,
object detection, image aesthetic assessment, and image generation.

Convolutional networks. Since AlexNet [48], convolutional neural networks
(ConvNets) have been used as de facto solutions to almost all vision tasks [8,13,
29,37,51,78,89,90,104] before the “Roaring 20s” [57]. Phenomenal architectural
improvements have been made in the past decade: residual [29] and dense con-
nections [37], fully-convolutional networks [58], encoder-decoder schemes [67],
feature pyramids [52], increased depths and widths [75], spatial- and channel-
wise attention models [36, 91], non-local interactions [88], to name a few. A
remarkable recent work ConvNeXt [57] has re-introduced core designs of vision
Transformers and shown that a ‘modernized’ pure ConvNet can achieve perfor-
mance comparable to Transformers on broad vision tasks.
Transformers in vision. Transformers were originally proposed for natural
language processing [85]. The debut of the Vision Transformer (ViT) [22] in 2020

showed that pure Transformer-based architectures are also eﬀective solutions for
vision problems. The elegantly novel view of ViT that treats image patches as
visual words has stimulated explosive research interest in visual Transformers. To
account for locality and 2D nature of images, the Swin Transformer aggregates
attention in shifted windows in a hierarchical architecture [56]. More recent
works have been focused on improving model and data eﬃciency, including sparse
attention [1,21,64,86,96,99], improved locality [27,101], pyramidal designs [24,87,
97], improved training strategies [3,81,82,105], etc. We refer readers to dedicated
surveys [44,44] of vision Transformers for a comprehensive review.
Hybrid models. Pure Transformer-based vision models have been observed to
generalize poorly due to relatively less inductive bias [19,22,81]. Vision Trans-
formers also exhibit substandard optimizability [94]. An intriguingly simple im-
provement is to adopt a hybrid design of Transformer and convolution layers
such as using a few convolutions to replace the coarse patchify stem [19,94]. A
broad range of works fall into this category, either explicitly hybridized [4, 19,
23,24,93,94,98] or in an implicit fashion [16,56].
Transformer for GANs. Transformers have also proven eﬀective in generative
adversarial networks (GANs) [26]. TransGAN [40] built a pure Transformer GAN
with a careful design of local attention and upsampling layers, demonstrating
eﬀectiveness on small scale datasets [18, 47]. GANformer [38] explored eﬃcient
global attention mechanisms to improve on StyleGAN [42] generator. HiT [103]
presents an eﬃcient Transformer generator based on local-global attention that
can scale up to 1K high-resolution image generation.

Method
Inspired by the sparse approaches presented in [83,103], we introduce a new type
of attention module, dubbed blocked multi-axis self-attention (Max-SA), by de-
composing the fully dense attention mechanisms into two sparse forms – window
attention and grid attention – which reduces the quadratic complexity of vanilla
attention to linear, without any loss of non-locality. Our sequential design of-
fers greater simplicity and ﬂexibility, while performing even better than previous
methods – each individual module can be used either standalone or combined in
any order (Tables 7-9), whereas parallel designs [83,103] oﬀer no such beneﬁts.
Because of the ﬂexibility and scalability of Max-SA, we are able to build a novel
vision backbone, which we call MaxViT, by simply stacking alternative layers of
Max-SA with MBConv [35] in a hierarchical architecture, as shown in Figure 2.
MaxViT beneﬁts from global and local receptive ﬁelds throughout the entire
network, from shallow to deep stages, demonstrating superior performance in
regards to both model capacity and generalization abilities.

Attention
Self-attention allows for spatial mixing of entire spatial (or sequence) locations
while also beneﬁting from content-dependent weights based on normalized pair-
wise similarity. The standard self-attention deﬁned in [22,85] is location-unaware,

i.e., non-translation equivariant, an important inductive bias imbued in Con-
vNets. Relative self-attention [19, 40, 56, 71] has been proposed to improve on
vanilla attention by introducing a relative learned bias added to the attention
weights, which has been shown to consistently outperform original attention on
many vision tasks [19,40,56]. In this work, we mainly adopt the pre-normalized
relative self-attention deﬁned in [19] as the key operator in MaxViT.
3.2
Multi-axis Attention
Global interaction is one of the key advantages of self-attention as compared to
local convolution. However, directly applying attention along the entire space
is computationally infeasible as the attention operator requires quadratic com-
plexity. To tackle this problem, we present a multi-axis approach to decompose
the full-size attention into two sparse forms – local and global – by simply de-
composing the spatial axes. Let X ∈RH×W ×C be an input feature map. Instead
of applying attention on the ﬂattened spatial dimension HW, we block the fea-
ture into a tensor of shape ( H
P × W
P , P × P, C), representing partitioning into
non-overlapping windows, each of size P × P. Applying self-attention on the
local spatial dimension i.e., P × P, is equivalent to attending within a small
window [56]. We will use this block attention to conduct local interactions.
Despite bypassing the notoriously heavy computation of full self-attention,
local-attention models have been observed to underﬁt on huge-scale datasets [19,
22]. Inspired by block attention, we present a surprisingly simple but eﬀective
way to gain sparse global attention, which we call grid attention. Instead of
partitioning feature maps using ﬁxed window size, we grid the tensor into the
shape (G×G, H
G × W
G , C) using a ﬁxed G×G uniform grid, resulting in windows

lustration of the multi-axis approach for computing self-attention (window/grid
size is 4×4). The block-attention module performs self-attention within windows,
while the grid-attention module attends globally to pixels in a sparse, uniform
grid overlaid on the entire 2D space, with both having linear complexity against
input size, as we use ﬁxed attention footage. The same colors are spatially mixed
by the self-attention operation.

G . Employing self-attention on the decomposed grid
axis i.e., G×G, corresponds to dilated, global spatial mixing of tokens. By using
the same ﬁxed window and grid sizes (we use P = G = 7 following Swin [56]),
we can fully balance the computation between local and global operations, both
having only linear complexity with respect to spatial size or sequence length.
Note that our proposed Max-SA module can be a drop-in replacement of the
Swin attention module [56] with exactly the same number of parameters and
FLOPs. Yet it enjoys global interaction capability without requiring masking,
padding, or cyclic-shifting, making it more implementation friendly, preferable
to the shifted window scheme [56]. For instance, the multi-axis attention can be
easily implemented with einops [66] without modifying the original attention
operation (see Appendix). It is worth mentioning that our proposed multi-axis
attention (Max-SA) is fundamentally diﬀerent from the axial-attention mod-
els [33,86]. Please see Appendix for a detailed comparison.
MaxViT block. We sequentially stack the two types of attentions to gain both
local and global interactions in a single block, as shown in Figure 3. Note that
we also adopt typical designs in Transformers [22,56], including LayerNorm [2],
Feedforward networks (FFNs) [22,56], and skip-connections. We also add a MB-
Conv block [35] with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) module [36] prior to the multi-
axis attention, as we have observed that using MBConv together with attention
further increases the generalization as well as the trainability of the network [94].
Using MBConv layers prior to attention oﬀers another advantage, in that depth-
wise convolutions can be regarded as conditional position encoding (CPE) [17],
making our model free of explicit positional encoding layers. Note that our pro-
posed stand-alone multi-axis attention may be used together or in isolation for
diﬀerent purposes – block attention for local interaction, and grid attention for
global mixing. These elements can be easily plugged into many vision architec-
tures, especially on high-resolution tasks that can beneﬁt by global interactions
with aﬀordable computation.

Architecture Variants
We designed a series of extremely simple architectural variants to explore the
eﬀectiveness of our proposed MaxViT block, as shown in Figure 2. We use a
hierarchical backbone similar to common ConvNet practices [19,29,57,80] where
the input is ﬁrst downsampled using Conv3x3 layers in stem stage (S0). The
body of the network contains four stages (S1-S4), with each stage having half
the resolution of the previous one with a doubled number of channels (hidden
dimension). In our network, we employ identical MaxViT blocks throughout the
entire backbone. We apply downsampling in the Depthwise Conv3x3 layer of the
ﬁrst MBConv block in each stage. The expansion and shrink rates for inverted
bottleneck [35] and squeeze-excitation (SE) [36] are 4 and 0.25 by default. We set
the attention head size to be 32 for all attention blocks. We scale up the model
by increasing block numbers per stage B and the channel dimension C. We
summarize the architectural conﬁgurations of the MaxViT variants in Table 1.

Experiments
We validated the eﬃcacy of our proposed model on various vision tasks: Ima-
geNet classiﬁcation [48], image object detection and instance segmentation [53],
image aesthetics/quality assessment [61], and unconditional image generation [26].
More experimental details can be found in the Appendix.

most recent strong hybrid model CoAtNet by a large margin across the entire
FLOPs spectrum, as shown in Figure 1a. The MaxViT-L model sets a new per-
formance record of 85.17% at 224 × 224 training without extra training strate-
gies, outperforming CoAtNet-3 by 0.67%. In regards to throughput-accuracy
trade-oﬀs at 2242, MaxViT-S obtains 84.45% top-1 accuracy, 0.25% higher than
CSWin-B and 0.35% higher than CoAtNet-2 with comparable throughput.

ing the previous best model CoAtNet-4 by 0.28% using only 43% of parameter
count and 38% of FLOPs, demonstrating greater parameter and computing ef-
ﬁciency. Figure 4a visualizes the model size comparison – MaxViT scales sig-
niﬁcantly better than previous attention-based models of similar complexities,
across the board. Additionally, the MaxViT-XL model achieves new SOTA per-
formance, an accuracy of 88.70% when ﬁne-tuned at resolution 512 × 512.

– MaxViT-XL achieves a high accuracy of 89.53% with 475 million parameters,
outperforming previous models under comparable model sizes. Due to resource

scale datasets (e.g., JFT-3B [102]) as future work.
4.2
Object Detection and Instance Segmentation
Setting. We evaluated the MaxViT architectures on the COCO2017 [53] object
bounding box detection and instance segmentation tasks with a two-stage frame-
work [65]. On the object detection task, a feature-pyramid architecture [52] was
employed to boost diﬀerent levels of objectiveness. In the instance segmentation
task, a well-known Cascade Mask-RCNN framework [28] was employed. The
dataset contains 118K training and 5K validation samples. For all the compared
models, the backbones are ﬁrst pretrained using ImageNet-1K. The pretrained
models are then used to ﬁnetune on the detection and segmentation tasks.
Results on COCO. As shown in Table 4, AP, AP50, and AP75 are reported
for comparison. The parameters and FLOPs are also reported as a reference for
model complexity. The MaxViT backbone models, used in object detection and
segmentation tasks, outperform all other backbones by large margins, including
Swin, ConvNeXt, and UViT at various model sizes with respect to both accuracy
and eﬃciency. Note that MaxViT-S outperforms other base-level models (e.g.,
Swin-B, UViT-B), with about 40% less computational cost.
4.3
Image Aesthetic Assessment.
Setting. We train and evaluate the MaxViT model on the AVA benchmark [61]
which contains 255K images with aesthetics scores rated by amateur photog-
raphers. Similar to [77], we split the dataset into 80%/20% training and test
sets. We followed [77] and used the normalized Earth Mover’s Distance as our

training loss. We trained MaxViT at three diﬀerent input resolutions: 2242, 3842
and 5122, initialized with ImageNet-1K pre-trained weights.
Results on AVA. To evaluate and compare our model against existing methods,
we present a summary of our results in Table 5. For similar input resolutions,
the proposed MaxViT-T model outperforms existing image aesthetic assessment
methods. As the input resolution increases, the performance improves, beneﬁting
from its strong non-local capacity. Also, MaxViT shows better linear correlation
compared to the SOTA method [43] which uses multi-resolution inputs.
4.4
Image Generation
Setting. We evaluate the generative ability of MaxViT blocks to generate im-
ages of 128x128 resolution on ImageNet-1K. We choose the unconditional image
generation to focus on the performance of diﬀerent generators in GANs. We use
the Inception Score (IS) [69] and the Fr´echet Inception Distance (FID) [32] as
quantitative evaluation metrics. 50,000 samples were randomly generated to cal-
culate the FID and IS scores. We compared MaxViT against HiT [103], a SOTA
generative Transformer model, which uses attention at low resolutions (e.g., 32,
64), and using implicit neural functions at high resolutions (e.g., 128). By con-
trast, MaxViT uses the proposed MaxViT block at every resolution. Note that
we use an inverse block order (GA-BA-Conv) as we found it to perform better (see
Table 8). Since Batch Normalization [39, 103] achieves better results on image
generation, we replaced all Layer Norm with Batch Norm under this setting.

Results on ImageNet-1K. The results are shown in Table 6. Our MaxViT
achieved better FID and IS with signiﬁcantly lower number of parameters. These
results demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of MaxViT blocks for generation tasks.
More details of the generative experiment can be found in Appendix.
4.5
Ablation Studies.
In this section, we ablate important design choices in MaxViT on ImageNet-
1K image classiﬁcation. We use the MaxViT-T model trained for 300 epochs
by default and report top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. Except for the ablated
design choice, we used the same training conﬁgurations, unless stated otherwise.
Global grid-attention. One of our main contributions is the grid-attention
module, which allows for sparse global interactions at linear time, enabling our
model to capture global information at all stages. We conducted two ablations
to understand its gain: 1) completely removed global attention at each stage; 2)
replaced grid attention with block attention to retain the same parameter count
and FLOPs. As Table 7 shows, enabling global attention at earlier stages can
further boost performance over using only local attention or convolutions.
MBConv layer. We also ablated the usage of MBConv layers in MaxViT by
removing all MBConv in each stage. Note that we should also consider the
reduction of parameter count and FLOPs when removing the MBConv layers.
Plus, Stage 3 has 5 blocks whereas other stages have only 2. As Table 9 shows,
the usage of MBConv layers in MaxViT signiﬁcantly boosts performance.
Block order study. We present three diﬀerent modules to build the MaxViT
block – MBConv, block-, and grid-attention – which captures spatial interactions
from local to global. To investigate the most eﬀective way to combine them,
we evaluated the MaxViT-T model using all 6 permutations. We always apply
downsampling in the ﬁrst layer, which might cause a minor model size diﬀerence.
We can observe from Table 8 that placing MBConv before attention layers is

almost always better than other combinations. The reason might be that it is
more suitable to get local features/patterns in early layers, then aggregate them
globally, which is aligned with existing hybrid models [19,94], which puts Conv
layers in front of attention. In generative experiments (Section 4.4), however, we
found the best order to be from global to local: GA-BA-C. We hypothesize that it
may be advantageous for generation tasks to ﬁrst obtain the overall structures
correct with global processing blocks (i.e., grid-attention layers), then ﬁll in ﬁner
details using local processing blocks (i.e., MBConv).
Sequential vs. parallel. In our approach, we sequentially stack the multi-axis
attention modules following [56, 86], while there also exist other models that
adopt a parallel design [83, 103]. In this ablation, we compare our sequential
Max-SA against parallel branches containing block- and grid-attention respec-
tively. Note that we use an input projection to double the channels, then split
the heads to feed the two branches in order to remain similar complexity to
MaxViT, and an output projection that reduces the concatenated branches. We
did rough parameter tuning and found that an initial learning rate of 10−3 per-

--- Page 14 ---

forms signiﬁcantly better than 3 × 10−3 for parallel models. We use all the same
parameters except the learning rate. As Table 10 shows, our sequential approach
remarkably outperforms parallel counterparts with fewer parameters and com-
putation. The reason may be that the parallel designs learn complementary cues
with less interactions between them, whereas our sequential stack is able to learn
more powerful fusions between local and global layers.

Vertical layout. We further examine our ver-

change MaxViT-T and -S to blocks B =
(2, 2, 6, 2), and MaxViT-B, -L to have blocks
B = (2, 2, 18, 2) strictly following the stage
ratio of Swin [56]. It may be seen from Fig-
ure 5 that our layout performed comparably
to Swin for small models, but scales signiﬁ-
cantly better for larger models.

Discussion and Conclusion
While recent works in the 2020s have arguably shown that ConvNets and vision
Transformers can achieve similar performance on image recognition, our work
presents a uniﬁed design that takes advantages of the best of both worlds –
eﬃcient convolution and sparse attention – and demonstrates that a model built
on top, namely MaxViT, can achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety
of vision tasks, and more importantly, scale extremely well to massive scale
data sizes. Even though we present our model in the context of vision tasks,
the proposed multi-axis approach can easily extend to language modeling to
capture both local and global dependencies in linear time. We also look forward
to studying other forms of sparse attention in higher-dimensional or multi-modal
signals such as videos, point clouds, and vision-languages.
Societal impact. Investigating the performance and scalability of large model
designs would consume considerable computing resources. These eﬀorts can con-
tribute to increased carbon emissions, which could hence raise environmental
concerns. However, the proposed model oﬀers strong modular candidates that
expand the network’s design space for future eﬀorts on automated architectural
design. If trained improperly, the proposed model may express bias and fairness
issues. The proposed generative model can be abused to generate misleading
media and fake news. These issues demand caution in future related research.

Backbone Details
MBConv MaxViT leverages the MBConv block [70,79] as the main convolution
operator. We also adopt a pre-activation structure [19,30] to promote homogene-
ity between MBConv and Transformer blocks. Speciﬁcally, assume x to be the
input feature, the MBConv block without downsampling is formulated as:
x ←x + Proj(SE(DWConv(Conv(Norm(x))))),
(1)
where Norm is BatchNorm [39], Conv is the expansion Conv1x1 followed by
BatchNorm and GELU [31] activation, a typical choice for Transformer-based
models. DWConv is the Depthwise Conv3x3 followed by BatchNorm and GELU.
SE is the Squeeze-Excitation layer [36], while Proj is the shrink Conv1x1 to down-
project the number of channels. Note that for the ﬁrst MBConv block in every
stage, the downsampling is done by applying stride-2 Depthwise Conv3x3 while
the shortcut branch should also apply pooling and channel projection:
x ←Proj(Pool2D(x)) + Proj(SE(DWConv↓(Conv(Norm(x))))).

Relative Attention Relative attention has been explored in several previous
studies for both NLP [71, 92] and vision [19, 40, 56, 84]. Here to simplify the
presentation, we present our model using only a single head of the multi-head
self-attention. In the actual implementation, we always use multi-head attention
with the same head dimension. The relative attention can be deﬁned as:
RelAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT /
√
d + B)V,
(3)
where Q, K, V ∈R(H×W )×C are the query, key, and value matrices and d is
the hidden dimension. The attention weights are co-decided by a learned static

location-aware matrix B and the scaled input-adaptive attention QKT /
√
d. Con-
sidering the diﬀerences in 2D coordinates, the relative position bias B is param-
eterized by a matrix ˆB ∈R(2H−1)(2W −1). Following typical practices [19, 56],
when ﬁne-tuned at a higher resolution e.g., H′ × W ′, we use bilinear interpola-
tion to map the relative positional bias from R(2H−1)(2W −1) to R(2H′−1)(2W ′−1).
This relative attention beneﬁts from input-adaptivity, translation equivariance,
and global interactions, which is a preferred choice over the vanilla self-attention
on 2D vision tasks. In our model, all the attention operators use this relative
attention deﬁned in Eq. 3 by default.
Multi-Axis Attention We assume the relative attention operator in Eq. 3
follows the convention for 1D input sequences i.e., always regards the second last
dimension of an input (..., L, C) as the spatial axis where L, C represent sequence
length and channels. The proposed Multi-Axis Attention can be implemented
without modiﬁcation to the self-attention operation. To start with, we ﬁrst deﬁne
the Block(·) operator with parameter P as partitioning the input image/feature
x ∈RH×W ×C into non-overlapping blocks with each block having size P × P.
Note that after window partition, the block dimensions are gathered onto the
spatial dimension (i.e., -2 axis):
Block : (H, W, C) →(H
P × P, W
P × P, C) →(HW
P 2 , P 2, C).
(4)
We denote the Unblock(·) operation as the reverse of the above block partition
procedure. Similarly, we deﬁne the Grid(·) operation with parameter G as divid-
ing the input feature into a uniform G×G grid, with each lattice having adaptive
size H
G × W
G . Unlike the block operator, we need to apply an extra Transpose to
place the grid dimension in the assumed spatial axis (i.e., -2 axis):
Grid : (H, W, C) →(G × H
G , G × W
G , C) →(G2, HW
G2 , C) →(HW
G2 , G2, C)
|
{z
}
swapaxes(axis1=-2,axis2=-3)
(5)
with its inverse operation Ungrid(·) that reverses the gridded input back to the
normal 2D feature space.
To this end, we are ready to explain the multi-axis attention module. Given
an input tensor x ∈RH×W ×C, the local Block Attention can be expressed as:
x ←x + Unblock(RelAttention(Block(LN(x))))
x ←x + MLP(LN(x))
(6)
while the global, dilated Grid Attention module is formulated as:
x ←x + Ungrid(RelAttention(Grid(LN(x))))
x ←x + MLP(LN(x))
(7)
where we omit the QKV input format in the RelAttention operation for sim-
plicity. LN denotes the Layer Normalization [2], where MLP is a standard MLP
network [22,56] consisting of two linear layers: x ←W2GELU(W1x).

(b) Multi-Axis Attention
Fig. 6: Comparison of Axial attention
and our proposed Multi-Axis attention.
Comparison to Axial attention It
should be noted that our proposed
multi-axis attention (Max-SA) mod-
ule is completely diﬀerent from the
axial attention proposed in [33, 86].
As shown in Figure 6(a), Axial atten-
tion proposes to ﬁrst apply column-
wise attention then row-wise, which
achieves a global receptive ﬁeld with
O(N
√
N) complexity (assuming N
equals to the number of pixels). On
the contrary, our proposed Max-SA
shown in Figure 6(b) ﬁrst employs lo-
cal attention, then sparse global attention, enjoying global receptive ﬁelds with
only O(N) linear complexity. Moreover, we deem the proposed Max-SA a more
natural approach for vision since the design of attended regions account for the
2D structure of images, e.g., mixing tokens in a spatially-local small window.
MaxViT Block We demonstrate in Algo. 1 an einops-style pseudocode of the
MaxViT block which contains MBConv, block attention, and grid attention.

def unblock(x,g,p):
return rearrange(x,"b(hw)(yx)c->b(hy)(wx)c",h=g,w=g,y=p,x=p)
x = MBConv(input) # MBConv layer
x = block(x,p) # window partition
x = RelSelfAttn(x) # Apply window-attention
x = unblock(x,x.shape[1]//p,p) # reverse
x = block(x,x.shape[1]//g) # grid partition
x = swapaxes(x,-2,-3) # move grid-axis to -2
x = RelSelfAttn(x) # Apply grid-attention
x = swapaxes(x,-2,-3) # reverse swapaxes
output = unblock(x,g,x.shape[1]//g) # reverse
Classiﬁcation Head Instead of using the [cls] token [22], we simply apply
global average pooling to the output of the last stage (S4) to obtain the feature
representation, followed by the ﬁnal classiﬁcation head.

Architectural Speciﬁcations Finally, we present detailed architectural spec-
iﬁcations for the MaxViT model family (T/S/B/L) in Table 11.
A.2
Detection and Segmentation Models
We follow the settings of the cascaded Faster-RCNN [65] and Mask-RCNN [28],
but replace the feature extraction backbone with our MaxViT backbone. We also
applied FPN [52] in the feature map generation, where the S2, S3, S4 (multi-
scale features of targeted resolution 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 in MaxViT, respectively)
are used. Then the generated feature maps are fed into the detection head. For
fair comparison, we follow the original implementation without adopting any
system-level strategies to further boost the ﬁnal performance, such as the HTC
framework [7], instaboost [25], etc. used in Swin [56]. We show the results of
MaxViT-T/S/B on these two tasks to compare it against recent strong models
at similar model complexity.
A.3
Image Aesthetics Model
This task requires incorporating both local and global information of an image to
accurately predict human perceptual preference. To this end, the model needs to

Fig. 7: Generator architecture using the MaxViT block for the GAN
experiment. In every stage, we ﬁrst use the cross-attention module to let the
features attend to the latent embedding projected from the input code, which
are then fed into the proposed MaxViT block consisting of grid attention, block
attention, and MBConv layer. Note that unlike the main model in Sec. A.1, the
order of applying the three layers are reversed: from global to local.
have the capacity to learn pixel-level quality aspects such as sharpness, noisiness
and contrast as well as semantic-level aspects such as composition and depth-
of-ﬁeld. We follow [77] and use the normalized Earth Mover’s Distance as our
training loss. Given the ground truth and predicted probability mass functions
p and bp representing the histogram of scores, the normalized Earth Mover’s
Distance can be expressed as:
EMD(p, bp) =
 
1
N

k=1
|CDFp(k) −CDFbp(k)|r

(8)
where CDFp(k) is the cumulative distribution function as Pk
i=1 pi, and N = 10
represents the number score bins. In our experiments we set r = 2. We remove
the classiﬁcation head used in MaxViT, and instead append a fully-connected
layer with 10 neurons followed by softmax.
A.4
GAN Model
The above image recognition tasks can validate the power of our proposed
MaxViT block used in downsampling (contracting) models. For this GAN exper-
iment, we would like to demonstrate its eﬀectiveness in upsampling (expanding)
architectures. The MaxViT-GAN model for image generation is illustrated in
Figure 7. For unconditional image generation, MaxViT-GAN ﬁrst takes a la-
tent code z ∼N(0, I) as input, then progressively generates an image of target

resolution through a hierarchically upsampling structure. We start by linearly
projecting the input to a feature with spatial dimension 8×8. During the gener-
ation, the feature will go through ﬁve stages consisting of identical GAN blocks
with gradually increased spatial resolution, similar to the design of our main
model. Similar to [103], we apply a cross-attention layer before the MaxViT
block as a memory-eﬃcient form of self-modulation in every stage, which has
been shown to stabilize GAN training and also improve mode coverage [11,103].
We use pixel shuﬄe [72] for upsampling in the end of each stage.

ImageNet Classiﬁcation
We provide ImageNet-1K experimental settings of MaxViT models for both pre-
training and ﬁne-tuning in Table 12. All the MaxViT variants used similar hy-
perparameters except that we mainly customize the stochastic depth rate to
regularize each model separately.

Coco Detection and Segmentation
We evaluated MaxViT on the COCO2017 [53] object bounding box detection
and instance segmentation tasks. The dataset contains 118K training and 5K
validation samples. All the MaxViT backbones used are pretrained on ImageNet-
1k at resolution 224 × 224. These pretrained checkpoints are then used as the
warm-up weights for ﬁne-tuning the detection and segmentation tasks. For both

--- Page 21 ---

21
tasks, the input images are resized to 896 × 896. The training is conducted with
a batch size of 256, using the AdamW [59] optimizer with learning rate of 1e-3,
3e-3, 3e-3, and stochastic depth of 0.8, 0.3, 0.3 for MaxViT-T/S/B, respectively.
B.3
Image Aesthetics Assessment
We trained and evaluated the MaxViT model on the AVA benchmark [61]. This
dataset consists of 255K images rated by armature photographers through pho-
tography contests. Each image is rated by an average of 200 human raters,
assigning a score from 1 to 10 to images. The higher the score, the better the
visual aesthetic quality of the image. Each image in the dataset has a histogram
of scores associated with it, which we use as the ground truth label. Similar
to [43, 77], we split the dataset into train and test sets, such that 20% of the
data is used for testing. We train MaxViT for three diﬀerent input resolutions:
224 × 224, 384 × 384 and 512 × 512. We initialized the model with ImageNet-1K
224×224 pre-trained weights. The weight and bias momentums are set to 0.9,
and a dropout rate of 0.75 is applied on the last layer of the baseline network.
We use an initial learning rate of 1e-3, exponentially decayed with decay factor
0.9 every 10 epochs. We set the stochastic depth rate to 0.5.
B.4
Image Generation
We use a ResNet-based discriminator following [42]. To train the model, we also
used the standard non-saturating logistic GAN loss with R1 gradient penalty [60]
applied to the discriminator with the gradient penalty weight set to 10. We
employ the Adam [45] optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4 for both generator
and discriminator. The model is trained on TPU for one million steps with batch
size 256. Notably, we do not employ extra GAN training tricks such as pixel
norm, noise injection, progressive growing, etc. on which recent state-of-the-art
models are heavily relied to attain good results [41, 42]. The overall objectives
of the GAN training are deﬁned as:
LG = −Ez∼Pz[log(D(G(z))],
(9)
LD = −Ex∼Px[log(D(x))] −Ez∼Pz[log(1 −D(G(z)))] + γEx∼Px[∥∇xD(x)∥2
2],
(10)
where γ denotes the R1 gradient penalty weight.
