Abstract
Although convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
achieved great success in computer vision, this work inves-
tigates a simpler, convolution-free backbone network use-
ful for many dense prediction tasks. Unlike the recently-
proposed Vision Transformer (ViT) that was designed for
image classiﬁcation speciﬁcally, we introduce the Pyra-
mid Vision Transformer (PVT), which overcomes the difﬁ-
culties of porting Transformer to various dense prediction
tasks. PVT has several merits compared to current state
of the arts. (1) Different from ViT that typically yields low-
resolution outputs and incurs high computational and mem-
ory costs, PVT not only can be trained on dense partitions
of an image to achieve high output resolution, which is im-
portant for dense prediction, but also uses a progressive
shrinking pyramid to reduce the computations of large fea-
ture maps. (2) PVT inherits the advantages of both CNN
and Transformer, making it a uniﬁed backbone for vari-

ous vision tasks without convolutions, where it can be used
as a direct replacement for CNN backbones. (3) We val-
idate PVT through extensive experiments, showing that it
boosts the performance of many downstream tasks, includ-
ing object detection, instance and semantic segmentation.
For example, with a comparable number of parameters,
PVT+RetinaNet achieves 40.4 AP on the COCO dataset,
surpassing ResNet50+RetinNet (36.3 AP) by 4.1 absolute
AP (see Figure 2). We hope that PVT could serve as an
alternative and useful backbone for pixel-level predictions
and facilitate future research.
1. Introduction
Convolutional neural network (CNNs) have achieved re-
markable success in computer vision, making them a ver-
satile and dominant approach for almost all tasks [54, 22,
73, 49, 21, 39, 9, 32]. Nevertheless, this work aims to ex-
plore an alternative backbone network beyond CNN, which
can be used for dense prediction tasks such as object detec-

tion [40, 14], semantic [83] and instance segmentation [40],
in addition to image classiﬁcation [12].
Inspired by the success of Transformer [64] in natu-
ral language processing, many researchers have explored
its application in computer vision.
For example, some
works [6, 85, 72, 56, 24, 42] model the vision task as a dic-
tionary lookup problem with learnable queries, and use the
Transformer decoder as a task-speciﬁc head on top of the
CNN backbone. Although some prior arts have also incor-
porated attention modules [70, 48, 80] into CNNs, as far
as we know, exploring a clean and convolution-free Trans-
former backbone to address dense prediction tasks in com-
puter vision is rarely studied.
Recently, Dosovitskiy et al. [13] introduced the Vision
Transformer (ViT) for image classiﬁcation. This is an in-
teresting and meaningful attempt to replace the CNN back-
bone with a convolution-free model. As shown in Figure 1
(b), ViT has a columnar structure with coarse image patches
as input.1
Although ViT is applicable to image classiﬁ-
cation, it is challenging to directly adapt it to pixel-level
dense predictions such as object detection and segmenta-
tion, because (1) its output feature map is single-scale and
low-resolution, and (2) its computational and memory costs
are relatively high even for common input image sizes (e.g.,
1Due to resource constraints, ViT cannot use ﬁne-grained image
patches (e.g., 4×4 pixels per patch) as input, instead only receive coarse
patches (e.g., 32×32 pixels per patch) as input, which leads to its low out-
put resolution (e.g., 32-stride).
shorter edge of 800 pixels in the COCO benchmark [40]).
To address the above limitations, this work proposes a
pure Transformer backbone, termed Pyramid Vision Trans-
former (PVT), which can serve as an alternative to the CNN
backbone in many downstream tasks, including image-level
prediction as well as pixel-level dense predictions. Speciﬁ-
cally, as illustrated in Figure 1 (c), our PVT overcomes the
difﬁculties of the conventional Transformer by (1) taking
ﬁne-grained image patches (i.e., 4×4 pixels per patch) as in-
put to learn high-resolution representation, which is essen-
tial for dense prediction tasks; (2) introducing a progressive
shrinking pyramid to reduce the sequence length of Trans-
former as the network deepens, signiﬁcantly reducing the
computational cost, and (3) adopting a spatial-reduction at-
tention (SRA) layer to further reduce the resource consump-
tion when learning high-resolution features.
Overall, the proposed PVT possesses the following mer-
its.
Firstly, compared to the traditional CNN backbones
(see Figure 1 (a)), which have local receptive ﬁelds that in-
crease with the network depth, our PVT always produces a
global receptive ﬁeld, which is more suitable for detection
and segmentation. Secondly, compared to ViT (see Fig-
ure 1 (b)), thanks to its advanced pyramid structure, our
method can more easily be plugged into many represen-
tative dense prediction pipelines, e.g., RetinaNet [39] and
Mask R-CNN [21]. Thirdly, we can build a convolution-
free pipeline by combining our PVT with other task-speciﬁc
Transformer decoders, such as PVT+DETR [6] for ob-
ject detection. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst entirely
convolution-free object detection pipeline.
Our main contributions are as follows:
(1) We propose Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT),
which is the ﬁrst pure Transformer backbone designed for
various pixel-level dense prediction tasks. Combining our
PVT and DETR, we can construct an end-to-end object de-
tection system without convolutions and handcrafted com-
ponents such as dense anchors and non-maximum suppres-
sion (NMS).
(2) We overcome many difﬁculties when porting Trans-
former to dense predictions, by designing a progressive
shrinking pyramid and a spatial-reduction attention (SRA).
These are able to reduce the resource consumption of Trans-
former, making PVT ﬂexible to learning multi-scale and
high-resolution features.
(3) We evaluate the proposed PVT on several differ-
ent tasks, including image classiﬁcation, object detection,
instance and semantic segmentation, and compare it with
popular ResNets [22] and ResNeXts [73].
As presented
in Figure 2, our PVT with different parameter scales can
consistently archived improved performance compared to
the prior arts. For example, under a comparable number
of parameters, using RetinaNet [39] for object detection,
PVT-Small achieves 40.4 AP on COCO val2017, outper-

forming ResNet50 by 4.1 points (40.4 vs. 36.3). Moreover,
PVT-Large achieves 42.6 AP, which is 1.6 points better than
ResNeXt101-64x4d, with 30% less parameters.
2. Related Work
2.1. CNN Backbones
CNNs are the work-horses of deep neural networks in vi-
sual recognition. The standard CNN was ﬁrst introduced in
[34] to distinguish handwritten numbers. The model con-
tains convolutional kernels with a certain receptive ﬁeld
that captures favorable visual context. To provide trans-
lation equivariance, the weights of convolutional kernels
are shared over the entire image space.
More recently,
with the rapid development of the computational resources
(e.g., GPU), the successful training of stacked convolutional
blocks [33, 54] on large-scale image classiﬁcation datasets
(e.g., ImageNet [51]) has become possible. For instance,
GoogLeNet [59] demonstrated that a convolutional opera-
tor containing multiple kernel paths can achieve very com-
petitive performance.
The effectiveness of a multi-path
convolutional block was further validated in Inception se-
ries [60, 58], ResNeXt [73], DPN [10], MixNet [65] and
SKNet [36]. Further, ResNet [22] introduced skip connec-
tions into the convolutional block, making it possible to cre-
ate/train very deep networks and obtaining impressive re-
sults in the ﬁeld of computer vision. DenseNet [25] intro-
duced a densely connected topology, which connects each
convolutional block to all previous blocks. More recent ad-
vances can be found in recent survey/review papers [31, 53].
Unlike the full-blown CNNs, the vision Transformer
backbone is still in its early stage of development. In this
work, we try to extend the scope of Vision Transformer by
designing a new versatile Transformer backbone suitable
for most vision tasks.
2.2. Dense Prediction Tasks
Preliminary. The dense prediction task aims to perform
pixel-level classiﬁcation or regression on a feature map.
Object detection and semantic segmentation are two rep-
resentative dense prediction tasks.
Object Detection.
In the era of deep learning,
CNNs [34] have become the dominant framework for ob-
ject detection, which includes single-stage detectors (e.g.,
SSD [43], RetinaNet [39], FCOS [62], GFL [37, 35], Po-
larMask [71] and OneNet [55]) and multi-stage detectors
(Faster R-CNN [49], Mask R-CNN [21], Cascade R-CNN
[4] and Sparse R-CNN [57]). Most of these popular ob-
ject detectors are built on high-resolution or multi-scale fea-
ture maps to obtain good detection performance. Recently,
DETR [6] and deformable DETR [85] combined the CNN
backbone and the Transformer decoder to build an end-
to-end object detector. Likewise, they also require high-
resolution or multi-scale feature maps for accurate object
detection.
Semantic Segmentation. CNNs also play an important
role in semantic segmentation. In the early stages, FCN
[44] introduced a fully convolutional architecture to gen-
erate a spatial segmentation map for a given image of any
size. After that, the deconvolution operation was introduced
by Noh et al. [47] and achieved impressive performance on
the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset [52]. Inspired by FCN, U-
Net [50] was proposed for the medical image segmentation
domain speciﬁcally, bridging the information ﬂow between
corresponding low-level and high-level feature maps of the
same spatial sizes. To explore richer global context rep-
resentation, Zhao et al. [81] designed a pyramid pooling
module over various pooling scales, and Kirillov et al. [32]
developed a lightweight segmentation head termed Seman-
tic FPN, based on FPN [38]. Finally, the DeepLab family
[8, 41] applies dilated convolutions to enlarge the receptive
ﬁeld while maintaining the feature map resolution. Similar
to object detection methods, semantic segmentation models
also rely on high-resolution or multi-scale feature maps.
2.3. Self-Attention and Transformer in Vision
As convolutional ﬁlter weights are usually ﬁxed after
training, they cannot be dynamically adapted to different
inputs. Many methods have been proposed to alleviate this
problem using dynamic ﬁlters [30] or self-attention oper-
ations [64]. The non-local block [70] attempts to model
long-range dependencies in both space and time, which
has been shown beneﬁcial for accurate video classiﬁca-
tion.
However, despite its success, the non-local opera-
tor suffers from the high computational and memory costs.
Criss-cross [26] further reduces the complexity by gen-
erating sparse attention maps through a criss-cross path.
Ramachandran et al. [48] proposed the stand-alone self-
attention to replace convolutional layers with local self-
attention units.
AANet [3] achieves competitive results
when combining the self-attention and convolutional oper-
ations. LambdaNetworks [2] uses the lambda layer, an ef-
ﬁcient self-attention to replace the convolution in the CNN.
DETR [6] utilizes the Transformer decoder to model ob-
ject detection as an end-to-end dictionary lookup problem
with learnable queries, successfully removing the need for
handcrafted processes such as NMS. Based on DETR, de-
formable DETR [85] further adopts a deformable atten-
tion layer to focus on a sparse set of contextual elements,
obtaining faster convergence and better performance. Re-
cently, Vision Transformer (ViT) [13] employs a pure
Transformer [64] model for image classiﬁcation by treat-
ing an image as a sequence of patches. DeiT [63] further
extends ViT using a novel distillation approach. Different
from previous models, this work introduces the pyramid
structure into Transformer to present a pure Transformer

backbone for dense prediction tasks, rather than a task-
speciﬁc head or an image classiﬁcation model.
3. Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT)
3.1. Overall Architecture
Our goal is to introduce the pyramid structure into the
Transformer framework, so that it can generate multi-scale
feature maps for dense prediction tasks (e.g., object detec-
tion and semantic segmentation). An overview of PVT is
depicted in Figure 3. Similar to CNN backbones [22], our
method has four stages that generate feature maps of dif-
ferent scales. All stages share a similar architecture, which
consists of a patch embedding layer and Li Transformer en-
coder layers.
In the ﬁrst stage, given an input image of size H×W×3,
we ﬁrst divide it into HW
42
patches,2 each of size 4×4×3.
Then, we feed the ﬂattened patches to a linear projection
and obtain embedded patches of size HW
42 ×C1. After that,
the embedded patches along with a position embedding are
passed through a Transformer encoder with L1 layers, and
the output is reshaped to a feature map F1 of size H
4×W
4 ×C1.
In the same way, using the feature map from the previ-
ous stage as input, we obtain the following feature maps:
F2, F3, and F4, whose strides are 8, 16, and 32 pixels
with respect to the input image. With the feature pyramid
{F1, F2, F3, F4}, our method can be easily applied to most

ture map at 4-stride.
downstream tasks, including image classiﬁcation, object de-
tection, and semantic segmentation.
3.2. Feature Pyramid for Transformer
Unlike CNN backbone networks [54, 22], which use
different convolutional strides to obtain multi-scale feature
maps, our PVT uses a progressive shrinking strategy to con-
trol the scale of feature maps by patch embedding layers.
Here, we denote the patch size of the i-th stage as Pi. At
the beginning of stage i, we ﬁrst evenly divide the input fea-
ture map Fi−1 ∈RHi−1×Wi−1×Ci−1 into Hi−1Wi−1
P 2
i
patches, and
then each patch is ﬂatten and projected to a Ci-dimensional
embedding. After the linear projection, the shape of the em-
bedded patches can be viewed as Hi−1
Pi × Wi−1
Pi ×Ci, where
the height and width are Pi times smaller than the input.
In this way, we can ﬂexibly adjust the scale of the feature
map in each stage, making it possible to construct a feature
pyramid for Transformer.
3.3. Transformer Encoder
The Transformer encoder in the stage i has Li encoder
layers, each of which is composed of an attention layer
and a feed-forward layer [64]. Since PVT needs to process
high-resolution (e.g., 4-stride) feature maps, we propose a
spatial-reduction attention (SRA) layer to replace the tradi-
tional multi-head attention (MHA) layer [64] in the encoder.
Similar to MHA, our SRA receives a query Q, a key K,
and a value V as input, and outputs a reﬁned feature. The
difference is that our SRA reduces the spatial scale of K

and V before the attention operation (see Figure 4), which
largely reduces the computational/memory overhead. De-
tails of the SRA in the stage i can be formulated as follows:
SRA(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head0, ..., headNi)W O,

j ∈RCi×dhead, and
W O ∈RCi×Ci are linear projection parameters. Ni is the
head number of the attention layer in Stage i. Therefore, the
dimension of each head (i.e., dhead) is equal to Ci
Ni . SR(·) is
the operation for reducing the spatial dimension of the input
sequence (i.e., K or V ), which is written as:
SR(x) = Norm(Reshape(x, Ri)W S).
(3)
Here, x ∈R(HiWi)×Ci represents a input sequence, and
Ri denotes the reduction ratio of the attention layers in
Stage i. Reshape(x, Ri) is an operation of reshaping the
input sequence x to a sequence of size HiWi

i Ci)×Ci is a linear projection that reduces the di-

layer normalization [1]. As in the original Transformer [64],
our attention operation Attention(·) is calculated as:
Attention(q, k, v) = Softmax( qkT
√dhead
)v.
(4)
Through these formulas, we can ﬁnd that the computa-
tional/memory costs of our attention operation are R2
i times
lower than those of MHA, so our SRA can handle larger
input feature maps/sequences with limited resources.
3.4. Model Details
In summary, the hyper parameters of our method are
listed as follows:
• Pi: the patch size of Stage i;
• Ci: the channel number of the output of Stage i;
• Li: the number of encoder layers in Stage i;
• Ri: the reduction ratio of the SRA in Stage i;
• Ni: the head number of the SRA in Stage i;
• Ei: the expansion ratio of the feed-forward layer [64]
in Stage i;
Following the design rules of ResNet [22], we (1) use small
output channel numbers in shallow stages; and (2) concen-
trate the major computation resource in intermediate stages.
To provide instances for discussion, we describe a series
of PVT models with different scales, namely PVT-Tiny, -
Small, -Medium, and -Large, in Table 1, whose parameter
numbers are comparable to ResNet18, 50, 101, and 152 re-
spectively. More details of employing these models in spe-
ciﬁc downstream tasks will be introduced in Section 4.
3.5. Discussion
The most related work to our model is ViT [13]. Here,
we discuss the relationship and differences between them.
First, both PVT and ViT are pure Transformer models with-
out convolutions.
The primary difference between them
is the pyramid structure. Similar to the traditional Trans-
former [64], the length of ViT’s output sequence is the same
as the input, which means that the output of ViT is single-
scale (see Figure 1 (b)). Moreover, due to the limited re-
source, the input of ViT is coarse-grained (e.g., the patch
size is 16 or 32 pixels), and thus its output resolution is rel-
atively low (e.g., 16-stride or 32-stride). As a result, it is
difﬁcult to directly apply ViT to dense prediction tasks that
require high-resolution or multi-scale feature maps.
Our PVT breaks the routine of Transformer by intro-
ducing a progressive shrinking pyramid.
It can gener-
ate multi-scale feature maps like a traditional CNN back-
bone.
In addition, we also designed a simple but effec-
tive attention layer—SRA, to process high-resolution fea-
ture maps and reduce computational/memory costs. Ben-
eﬁting from the above designs, our method has the fol-
lowing advantages over ViT: 1) more ﬂexible—can gen-
erate feature maps of different scales/channels in differ-
ent stages; 2) more versatile—can be easily plugged and
played in most downstream task models; 3) more friendly
to computation/memory—can handle higher resolution fea-
ture maps or longer sequences.
4. Application to Downstream Tasks
4.1. Image-Level Prediction
Image classiﬁcation is the most classical task of image-
level prediction. To provide instances for discussion, we

numbers are similar to ResNet18, 50, 101, and 152, respec-

DeiT [63] to append a learnable classiﬁcation token to the
input of the last stage, and then employ a fully connected
(FC) layer to conduct classiﬁcation on top of the token.
4.2. Pixel-Level Dense Prediction
In addition to image-level prediction, dense prediction
that requires pixel-level classiﬁcation or regression to be
performed on the feature map, is also often seen in down-
stream tasks. Here, we discuss two typical tasks, namely
object detection, and semantic segmentation.
We apply our PVT models to three representative dense
prediction methods, namely RetinaNet [39], Mask R-
CNN [21], and Semantic FPN [32]. RetinaNet is a widely
used single-stage detector, Mask R-CNN is the most pop-
ular two-stage instance segmentation framework, and Se-
mantic FPN is a vanilla semantic segmentation method
without special operations (e.g., dilated convolution). Us-
ing these methods as baselines enables us to adequately ex-
amine the effectiveness of different backbones.
The implementation details are as follows:
(1) Like
ResNet, we initialize the PVT backbone with the weights
pre-trained on ImageNet; (2) We use the output feature
pyramid {F1, F2, F3, F4} as the input of FPN [38], and
then the reﬁned feature maps are fed to the follow-up de-
tection/segmentation head; (3) When training the detec-
tion/segmentation model, none of the layers in PVT are
frozen; (4) Since the input for detection/segmentation can
be an arbitrary shape, the position embeddings pre-trained
on ImageNet may no longer be meaningful. Therefore, we
perform bilinear interpolation on the pre-trained position
embeddings according to the input resolution.
5. Experiments
We compare PVT with the two most representative CNN
backbones, i.e., ResNet [22] and ResNeXt [73], which are
widely used in the benchmarks of many downstream tasks.
5.1. Image Classiﬁcation
Settings. Image classiﬁcation experiments are performed
on the ImageNet 2012 dataset [51], which comprises 1.28
million training images and 50K validation images from
1,000 categories.
For fair comparison, all models are
trained on the training set, and report the top-1 error on the
validation set. We follow DeiT [63] and apply random crop-
ping, random horizontal ﬂipping [59], label-smoothing reg-
ularization [60], mixup [78], CutMix [76], and random eras-
ing [82] as data augmentations. During training, we employ
AdamW [46] with a momentum of 0.9, a mini-batch size of
128, and a weight decay of 5 × 10−2 to optimize models.
The initial learning rate is set to 1×10−3 and decreases fol-
lowing the cosine schedule [45]. All models are trained for
300 epochs from scratch on 8 V100 GPUs. To benchmark,
we apply a center crop on the validation set, where a 224×
224 patch is cropped to evaluate the classiﬁcation accuracy.
Results. In Table 2, we see that our PVT models are supe-
rior to conventional CNN backbones under similar parame-
ter numbers and computational budgets. For example, when

the GFLOPs are roughly similar, the top-1 error of PVT-
Small reaches 20.2, which is 1.3 points higher than that of
ResNet50 [22] (20.2 vs. 21.5). Meanwhile, under similar or
lower complexity, PVT models archive performances com-
parable to the recently proposed Transformer-based mod-
els, such as ViT [13] and DeiT [63] (PVT-Large: 18.3 vs.
ViT(DeiT)-Base/16: 18.3). Here, we clarify that these re-
sults are within our expectations, because the pyramid struc-
ture is beneﬁcial to dense prediction tasks, but brings little
improvements to image classiﬁcation.
Note that ViT and DeiT have limitations as they are
speciﬁcally designed for classiﬁcation tasks, and thus are
not suitable for dense prediction tasks, which usually re-
quire effective feature pyramids.
5.2. Object Detection
Settings. Object detection experiments are conducted on
the challenging COCO benchmark [40].
All models are
trained on COCO train2017 (118k images) and evalu-
ated on val2017 (5k images). We verify the effectiveness
of PVT backbones on top of two standard detectors, namely
RetinaNet [39] and Mask R-CNN [21]. Before training, we
use the weights pre-trained on ImageNet to initialize the
backbone and Xavier [18] to initialize the newly added lay-
ers. Our models are trained with a batch size of 16 on 8
V100 GPUs and optimized by AdamW [46] with an ini-
tial learning rate of 1 × 10−4. Following common prac-
tices [39, 21, 7], we adopt 1× or 3× training schedule (i.e.,
12 or 36 epochs) to train all detection models. The training
image is resized to have a shorter side of 800 pixels, while
the longer side does not exceed 1,333 pixels. When using
the 3× training schedule, we randomly resize the shorter
side of the input image within the range of [640, 800]. In
the testing phase, the shorter side of the input image is ﬁxed
to 800 pixels.
Results. As shown in Table 3, when using RetinaNet for
object detection, we ﬁnd that under comparable number of
parameters, the PVT-based models signiﬁcantly surpasses
their counterparts. For example, with the 1× training sched-
ule, the AP of PVT-Tiny is 4.9 points better than that of
ResNet18 (36.7 vs. 31.8). Moreover, with the 3× training
schedule and multi-scale training, PVT-Large archive the
best AP of 43.4, surpassing ResNeXt101-64x4d (43.4 vs.
41.8), while our parameter number is 30% fewer. These re-
sults indicate that our PVT can be a good alternative to the
CNN backbone for object detection.
Similar results are found in instance segmentation exper-
iments based on Mask R-CNN, as shown in Table 4. With
the 1× training schedule, PVT-Tiny achieves 35.1 mask AP
(APm), which is 3.9 points better than ResNet18 (35.1 vs.
31.2) and even 0.7 points higher than ResNet50 (35.1 vs.
34.4). The best APm obtained by PVT-Large is 40.7, which
is 1.0 points higher than ResNeXt101-64x4d (40.7 vs. 39.7),
with 20% fewer parameters.
5.3. Semantic Segmentation
Settings. We choose ADE20K [83], a challenging scene
parsing dataset, to benchmark the performance of semantic
segmentation. ADE20K contains 150 ﬁne-grained semantic
categories, with 20,210, 2,000, and 3,352 images for train-
ing, validation, and testing, respectively. We evaluate our
PVT backbones on the basis of Semantic FPN [32], a sim-
ple segmentation method without dilated convolutions [74].
In the training phase, the backbone is initialized with the
weights pre-trained on ImageNet [12], and other newly
added layers are initialized with Xavier [18]. We optimize
our models using AdamW [46] with an initial learning rate
of 1e-4. Following common practices [32, 8], we train our
models for 80k iterations with a batch size of 16 on 4 V100
GPUs. The learning rate is decayed following the polyno-
mial decay schedule with a power of 0.9. We randomly
resize and crop the image to 512 × 512 for training, and
rescale to have a shorter side of 512 pixels during testing.
Results.
As shown in Table 5, when using Seman-
tic FPN [32] for semantic segmentation,
PVT-based
models consistently outperforms the models based on
ResNet [22] or ResNeXt [73].

In addition, although the parameter
number and GFLOPs of our PVT-Large are 20% lower than
those of ResNeXt101-64x4d, the mIoU is still 1.9 points
higher (42.1 vs. 40.2). With a longer training schedule and
multi-scale testing, PVT-Large+Semantic FPN archives the
best mIoU of 44.8, which is very close to the state-of-the-art
performance of the ADE20K benchmark. Note that Seman-
tic FPN is just a simple segmentation head. These results
demonstrate that our PVT backbones can extract better fea-
tures for semantic segmentation than the CNN backbone,

5.4. Pure Transformer Detection & Segmentation
PVT+DETR. To reach the limit of no convolution, we build
a pure Transformer pipeline for object detection by sim-
ply combining our PVT with a Transformer-based detection
head—DETR [6]. We train models on COCO train2017
for 50 epochs with an initial learning rate of 1 × 10−4.
The learning rate is divided by 10 at the 33rd epoch. We
use random ﬂipping and multi-scale training as data aug-
mentation. All other experimental settings is the same as
those in Sec. 5.2. As reported in Table 6, PVT-based DETR
archieves 34.7 AP on COCO val2017, outperforming
the original ResNet50-based DETR by 2.4 points (34.7 vs.
32.3). These results prove that a pure Transformer detector
can also works well in the object detection task.

Trans2Seg [72], a Transformer-based segmentation head.
According to the experimental settings in Sec. 5.3, we

ations training,
single scale testing,
and compare it
with ResNet50+Trans2Seg [72] and DeeplabV3+ [9] with
ResNet50-d8 (dilation 8) and -d16(dilation 8) in Table
7. We ﬁnd that our PVT-Small+Trans2Seg achieves 42.6
mIoU, outperforming ResNet50-d8+DeeplabV3+ (41.5).
Note that, ResNet50-d8+DeeplabV3+ has 120.5 GFLOPs
due to the high computation cost of dilated convolution, and
our method has only 31.6 GFLOPs, which is 4 times fewer.
In addition, our PVT-Small+Trans2Seg performs better than
ResNet50-d16+Trans2Seg (mIoU: 42.6 vs. 39.7, GFlops:
31.6 vs. 79.3). These results prove that a pure Transformer
segmentation network is workable.
5.5. Ablation Study
Settings. We conduct ablation studies on ImageNet [12]
and COCO [40] datasets. The experimental settings on Im-
ageNet are the same as the settings in Sec. 5.1. For COCO,
all models are trained with a 1× training schedule (i.e., 12
epochs) and without multi-scale training, and other settings
follow those in Sec. 5.2.
Pyramid Structure. A Pyramid structure is crucial when
applying Transformer to dense prediction tasks. ViT (see
Figure 1 (b)) is a columnar framework, whose output is
single-scale. This results in a low-resolution output fea-
ture map when using coarse image patches (e.g., 32×32
pixels per patch) as input, leading to poor detection perfor-

mance (31.7 AP on COCO val2017),3 as shown in Table
8. When using ﬁne-grained image patches (e.g., 4×4 pixels
per patch) as input like our PVT, ViT will exhaust the GPU
memory (32G). Our method avoids this problem through a
progressive shrinking pyramid. Speciﬁcally, our model can
process high-resolution feature maps in shallow stages and
low-resolution feature maps in deep stages. Thus, it obtains
a promising AP of 40.4 on COCO val2017, 8.7 points
higher than ViT-Small/32 (40.4 vs. 31.7).
Deeper vs. Wider. The problem of whether the CNN back-
bone should go deeper or wider has been extensively dis-
cussed in previous work [22, 77]. Here, we explore this
3For adapting ViT to RetinaNet, we extract the features from the layer
2, 4, 6, and 8 of ViT-Small/32, and interpolate them to different scales.

problem in our PVT. For fair comparisons, we multiply
the hidden dimensions {C1, C2, C3, C4} of PVT-Small by
a scale factor 1.4 to make it have an equivalent parameter
number to the deep model (i.e., PVT-Medium). As shown
in Table 9, the deep model (i.e., PVT-Medium) consistently
works better than the wide model (i.e., PVT-Small-Wide) on
both ImageNet and COCO. Therefore, going deeper is more
effective than going wider in the design of PVT. Based on
this observation, in Table 1, we develop PVT models with
different scales by increasing the model depth.
Pre-trained Weights. Most dense prediction models (e.g.,
RetinaNet [39]) rely on the backbone whose weights are
pre-trained on ImageNet. We also discuss this problem in
our PVT. In the top of Figure 5, we plot the validation AP
curves of RetinaNet-PVT-Small w/ (red curves) and w/o
(blue curves) pre-trained weights. We ﬁnd that the model
w/ pre-trained weights converges better than the one w/o
pre-trained weights, and the gap between their ﬁnal AP
reaches 13.8 under the 1× training schedule and 8.4 under
the 3× training schedule and multi-scale training. There-
fore, like CNN-based models, pre-training weights can also
help PVT-based models converge faster and better. More-
over, in the bottom of Figure 5, we also see that the con-
vergence speed of PVT-based models (red curves) is faster
than that of ResNet-based models (green curves).
PVT vs. “CNN w/ Non-Local” To obtain a global recep-
tive ﬁeld, some well-engineered CNN backbones, such as
GCNet [5], integrate the non-local block in the CNN frame-
work. Here, we compare the performance of our PVT (pure
Transformer) and GCNet (CNN w/ non-local), using Mask
R-CNN for instance segmentation. As reported in Table
10, we ﬁnd that our PVT-Small outperforms ResNet50+GC
r4 [5] by 1.6 points in APm (37.8 vs. 36.2), and 2.0 points in
APm
75 (38.3 vs. 40.3), under comparable parameter number
and GFLOPs. There are two possible reasons for this result:
(1) Although a single global attention layer (e.g., non-
local [70] or multi-head attention (MHA) [64]) can ac-
quire global-receptive-ﬁeld features, the model perfor-
mance keeps improving as the model deepens. This indi-
cates that stacking multiple MHAs can further enhance the
representation capabilities of features. Therefore, as a pure
Transformer backbone with more global attention layers,
our PVT tends to perform better than the CNN backbone

“Scale” and “Time” denote the input scale and time cost
per image. When the shorter side is 640 pixels, the PVT-

V100 GPU) than ResNet50+RetinaNet, while obtaining 2.4
points better AP (38.7 vs. 36.3).
equipped with non-local blocks (e.g., GCNet).
(2) Regular convolutions can be deemed as special in-
stantiations of spatial attention mechanisms [84]. In other
words, the format of MHA is more ﬂexible than the regular
convolution. For example, for different inputs, the weights
of the convolution are ﬁxed, but the attention weights of
MHA change dynamically with the input. Thus, the features
learned by the pure Transformer backbone full of MHA lay-
ers, could be more ﬂexible and expressive.
Computation Overhead. With increasing input scale, the
growth rate of the GFLOPs of our PVT is greater than
ResNet [22], but lower than ViT [13], as shown in Figure
6. However, when the input scale does not exceed 640×640
pixels, the GFLOPs of PVT-Small and ResNet50 are simi-
lar. This means that our PVT is more suitable for tasks with
medium-resolution input.
On COCO, the shorter side of the input image is 800
pixels. Under this condition, the inference speed of Reti-
naNet based on PVT-Small is slower than the ResNet50-
based model, as reported in Table 11. (1) A direct solution
for this problem is to reduce the input scale. When reduc-
ing the shorter side of the input image to 640 pixels, the
model based on PVT-Small runs faster than the ResNet50-
based model (51.7ms vs., 55.9ms), with 2.4 higher AP
(38.7 vs. 36.3). 2) Another solution is to develop a self-
attention layer with lower computational complexity. This
is a worth exploring direction, we recently propose a solu-
tion PVTv2 [67].
Detection & Segmentation Results. In Figure 7, we also
present some qualitative object detection and instance seg-
mentation results on COCO val2017 [40], and semantic
segmentation results on ADE20K [83]. These results indi-
cate that a pure Transformer backbone (i.e., PVT) without
convolutions can also be easily plugged in dense prediction
models (e.g., RetinaNet [39], Mask R-CNN [21], and Se-
mantic FPN [32]), and obtain high-quality results.
6. Conclusions and Future Work
We introduce PVT, a pure Transformer backbone for
dense prediction tasks, such as object detection and seman-

tic segmentation. We develop a progressive shrinking pyra-
mid and a spatial-reduction attention layer to obtain high-
resolution and multi-scale feature maps under limited com-
putation/memory resources. Extensive experiments on ob-
ject detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks ver-
ify that our PVT is stronger than well-designed CNN back-
bones under comparable numbers of parameters.
Although PVT can serve as an alternative to CNN back-
bones (e.g., ResNet, ResNeXt), there are still some speciﬁc
modules and operations designed for CNNs and not consid-
ered in this work, such as SE [23], SK [36], dilated convo-
lution [74], model pruning [20], and NAS [61]. Moreover,
with years of rapid developments, there have been many
well-engineered CNN backbones such as Res2Net [17],
EfﬁcientNet [61], and ResNeSt [79].
In contrast, the
Transformer-based model in computer vision is still in
its early stage of development.
Therefore, we believe
there are many potential technologies and applications (e.g.,
OCR [68, 66, 69], 3D [28, 11, 27] and medical [15, 16, 29]
image analysis) to be explored in the future, and hope that
PVT could serve as a good starting point.
