Abstract
The generalization and learning speed of a multi-class neural network can often
be signiﬁcantly improved by using soft targets that are a weighted average of the
hard targets and the uniform distribution over labels. Smoothing the labels in this
way prevents the network from becoming over-conﬁdent and label smoothing has
been used in many state-of-the-art models, including image classiﬁcation, language
translation and speech recognition. Despite its widespread use, label smoothing is
still poorly understood. Here we show empirically that in addition to improving
generalization, label smoothing improves model calibration which can signiﬁcantly
improve beam-search. However, we also observe that if a teacher network is
trained with label smoothing, knowledge distillation into a student network is much
less effective. To explain these observations, we visualize how label smoothing
changes the representations learned by the penultimate layer of the network. We
show that label smoothing encourages the representations of training examples
from the same class to group in tight clusters. This results in loss of information
in the logits about resemblances between instances of different classes, which is
necessary for distillation, but does not hurt generalization or calibration of the
model’s predictions.

Introduction
It is widely known that neural network training is sensitive to the loss that is minimized. Shortly
after Rumelhart et al. [1] derived backpropagation for the quadratic loss function, several researchers
noted that better classiﬁcation performance and faster convergence could be attained by performing
gradient descent to minimize cross entropy [2, 3]. However, even in these early days of neural
network research, there were indications that other, more exotic objectives could outperform the
standard cross entropy loss [4, 5]. More recently, Szegedy et al. [6] introduced label smoothing,
which improves accuracy by computing cross entropy not with the “hard" targets from the dataset,
but with a weighted mixture of these targets with the uniform distribution.
Label smoothing has been used successfully to improve the accuracy of deep learning models across
a range of tasks, including image classiﬁcation, speech recognition, and machine translation (Table 1).
Szegedy et al. [6] originally proposed label smoothing as a strategy that improved the performance of
the Inception architecture on the ImageNet dataset, and many state-of-the-art image classiﬁcation
models have incorporated label smoothing into training procedures ever since [7, 8, 9]. In speech
recognition, Chorowski and Jaitly [10] used label smoothing to reduce the word error rate on the
WSJ dataset. In machine translation, Vaswani et al. [11] attained a small but important improvement
in BLEU score, despite a reduction in perplexity.
Although label smoothing is a widely used “trick" to improve network performance, not much is
known about why and when label smoothing should work. This paper tries to shed light upon behavior

of neural networks trained with label smoothing, and we describe several intriguing properties of
these networks. Our contributions are as follows:
• We introduce a novel visualization method based on linear projections of the penultimate
layer activations. This visualization provides intuition regarding how representations differ
between penultimate layers of networks trained with and without label smoothing.
• We demonstrate that label smoothing implicitly calibrates learned models so that the conﬁ-
dences of their predictions are more aligned with the accuracies of their predictions.
• We show that label smoothing impairs distillation, i.e., when teacher models are trained with
label smoothing, student models perform worse. We further show that this adverse effect
results from loss of information in the logits.
1.1
Preliminaries
Before describing our ﬁndings, we provide a mathematical description of label smoothing. Suppose
we write the prediction of a neural network as a function of the activations in the penultimate layer
as pk =
exT wk
PL
l=1 exT wl , where pk is the likelihood the model assigns to the k-th class, wk represents
the weights and biases of the last layer, x is the vector containing the activations of the penultimate
layer of a neural network concatenated with "1" to account for the bias. For a network trained with
hard targets, we minimize the expected value of the cross-entropy between the true targets yk and
the network’s outputs pk as in H(y, p) = PK
k=1 −yk log(pk), where yk is "1" for the correct class
and "0" for the rest. For a network trained with a label smoothing of parameter α, we minimize
instead the cross-entropy between the modiﬁed targets yLS
k
and the networks’ outputs pk, where
yLS
k
= yk(1 −α) + α/K.

Penultimate layer representations
Training a network with label smoothing encourages the differences between the logit of the correct
class and the logits of the incorrect classes to be a constant dependent on α. By contrast, training
a network with hard targets typically results in the correct logit being much larger than the any
of the incorrect logits and also allows the incorrect logits to be very different from one another.
Intuitively, the logit xT wk of the k-th class can be thought of as a measure of the squared Euclidean
distance between the activations of the penultimate layer x and a template wk, as ||x −wk||2 =
xT x −2xT wk + wT
k wk. Here, each class has a template wk, xT x is factored out when calculating
the softmax outputs and wT
k wk is usually constant across classes. Therefore, label smoothing
encourages the activations of the penultimate layer to be close to the template of the correct class and
equally distant to the templates of the incorrect classes. To observe this property of label smoothing,
we propose a new visualization scheme based on the following steps: (1) Pick three classes, (2)
Find an orthonormal basis of the plane crossing the templates of these three classes, (3) Project the
penultimate layer activations of examples from these three classes onto this plane. This visualization
shows in 2-D how the activations cluster around the templates and how label smoothing enforces a
structure on the distance between the examples and the clusters from the other classes.
In Fig. 1, we show results of visualizing penultimate layer representations of image classiﬁers trained
on the datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with the architectures AlexNet [12], ResNet-56
[13] and Inception-v4 [14], respectively. Table 2 shows the effect of label smoothing on the accuracy
of these models. We start by describing visualization results for CIFAR-10 (ﬁrst row of Fig. 1) for
the classes “airplane," “automobile" and “bird." The ﬁrst two columns represent examples from the
training and validation set for a network trained without label smoothing (w/o LS). We observe that

the projections are spread into deﬁned but broad clusters. The last two columns show a network
trained with a label smoothing factor of 0.1. We observe that now the clusters are much tighter,
because label smoothing encourages that each example in training set to be equidistant from all the
other class’s templates. Therefore, when looking at the projections, the clusters organize in regular
triangles when training with label smoothing, whereas the regular triangle structure is less discernible
in the case of training with hard-targets (no label smoothing). Note that these networks have similar
accuracies despite qualitatively different clustering of activations.
In the second row, we investigate the activation’s geometry for a different pair of dataset/architecture
(CIFAR-100/ResNet-56). Again, we observe the same behavior for classes “beaver," “dolphin,"
“otter." In contrast to the previous example, now the networks trained with label smoothing have
better accuracy. Additionally, we observe the different scale of the projections between the network
trained with and without label smoothing. With label smoothing, the difference between logits of two
classes has to be limited in absolute value to get the desired soft target for the correct and incorrect
3

--- Page 4 ---
classes. Without label smoothing, however, the projection can take much higher absolute values,
which represent over-conﬁdent predictions.
Finally, we test our visualization scheme in an Inception-v4/ImageNet experiment and observe the
effect of label smoothing for semantically similar classes, since ImageNet has many ﬁne-grained
classes (e.g. different breeds of dogs). The third row represents projections for semantically different
classes (tench, meerkat and cleaver) with the behavior similar to previous experiments. The fourth
row is more interesting, since we pick two semantically similar classes (toy poodle and miniature
poodle) and observe the projection with the presence of a third semantically different one (tench, in
blue). With hard targets, the semantically similar classes cluster close to each other with an isotropic
spread. On the contrary, with label smoothing these similar classes lie in an arc. In both cases,
the semantically similar classes are harder to separate even on the training set, but label smoothing
enforces that each example be equidistant to all remaining class’s templates, which gives rise to
arc shape behavior with respect to other classes. We also observe that when training without label
smoothing there is continuous degree of change between the "tench" cluster and the "poodles" cluster.
We can potentially measure "how much a poodle is a particular tench". However, when training
with label smoothing this information is virtually erased. This erasure of information is shown in
the Section 4. Finally, the ﬁgure shows that the effect of label smoothing on representations is
independent of architecture, dataset and accuracy.

Implicit model calibration
By artiﬁcially softening the targets, label smoothing prevents the network from becoming over-
conﬁdent. But does it improve the calibration of the model by making the conﬁdence of its predictions
more accurately represent their accuracy? In this section, we seek to answer this question. Guo
et al. [15] have shown that modern neural networks are poorly calibrated and over-conﬁdent despite
having better performance than better calibrated networks from the past. To measure calibration, the
authors computed the estimated expected calibration error (ECE). They demonstrated that a simple
post-processing step, temperature scaling, can reduce ECE and calibrate the network. Temperature
scaling consists in multiplying the logits by a scalar before applying the softmax operator. Here, we
show that label smoothing also reduces ECE and can be used to calibrate a network without the need
for temperature scaling.
Image classiﬁcation. We start by investigating the calibration of image classiﬁcation models. Fig. 2
(left) shows the 15-bin reliability diagram of a ResNet-56 trained on CIFAR-100. The dashed line
represent perfect calibration where the output likelihood (conﬁdence) predicts perfectly the accuracy.
Without temperature scaling, the model trained with hard targets (blue line without markers) is clearly
over-conﬁdent, since in expectation the accuracy is always below the conﬁdence. To calibrate the
model, one can tune the softmax temperature a posteriori (blue line with crosses) to a temperature
of 1.9. We observe that the reliability diagram slope is now much closer to a slope of 1 and the
model is better calibrated. We also show that, in terms of calibration, label smoothing has a similar
effect. By training the same model with α = 0.05 (green line), we obtain a model that is similarly
calibrated compared to temperature scaling. In Table 3, we observe how varying label smoothing and
temperature scaling affects ECE. Both methods can be used to reduce ECE to a similar and smaller
value than an uncalibrated network trained with hard targets.
We also performed experiments on ImageNet (Fig. 2 right). Again, the network trained with hard
targets (blue curve without markers) is over-conﬁdent and achieves a high ECE of 0.071. Using
temperature scaling (T= 1.4), ECE is reduced to 0.022 (blue curve with crosses). Although we did
not tune α extensively, we found that label smoothing of α = 0.1 improves ECE to 0.035, resulting
in better calibration compared to the unscaled network trained with hard targets.
These results are somewhat surprising in light of the penultimate layer visualizations of these networks
shown in the previous section. Despite trying to collapse the training examples to tiny clusters, these
networks generalize and are calibrated. Looking at the label smoothing representations for CIFAR-
100 in Fig. 1 (second row, two last columns), we clearly observe this behavior. The red cluster is very
tight in the training set, but in the validation set it spreads towards the center representing the full
range of conﬁdences for each prediction.
Machine translation. We also investigate the calibration of a model trained on the English-to-
German translation task using the Transformer architecture. This setup is interesting for two reasons.
First, Vaswani et al. [11] noted that label smoothing with α = 0.1 improved the BLEU score of

their ﬁnal model despite attaining worse perplexity compared to a model trained with hard targets
(α = 0.0). So we compare both setups in terms of calibration to verify that label smoothing also
improves calibration in this task. Second, compared to image classiﬁcation, where calibration does
not directly affect the metric we care about (accuracy), in language translation, the network’s soft
outputs are inputs to a second algorithm (beam-search) which is affected by calibration. Since
beam-search approximates a maximum likelihood sequence detection algorithm (Viterbi algorithm),
we would intuitively expect better performance for a better calibrated model, since the model’s
conﬁdence predicts better the accuracy of the next token.
Figure 3: Reliability diagram of Trans-
former trained on EN-DE dataset.
We start by looking at the reliability diagram (Fig. 3)
for a Transformer network trained with hard targets
(with and without temperature scaling) and a network
trained with label smoothing (α = 0.1). We plot cali-
bration of the next-token predictions assuming a correct
preﬁx on the validation set. The results are in agree-
ment with the previous experiments on CIFAR-100 and
ImageNet, and indeed the Transformer network [11]
with label smoothing is better calibrated than the hard
targets alternative.
Despite being better calibrated and achieving better
BLEU scores, label smoothing results in worse nega-
tive log-likelihoods (NLL) than hard targets. Moreover,
temperature scaling with hard targets is insufﬁcient to
recover the BLEU score improvement obtained with
label smoothing. In Fig. 4, we artiﬁcially vary calibra-
tion of both networks, using temperature scaling, and analyze the effect upon BLEU and NLL. The
left panel shows results for a network trained with hard targets. By increasing the temperature we
can both reduce ECE (red, right y-axis) and slightly improve BLEU score (blue left y-axis), but the
BLEU score improvement is not enough to match the BLEU score of the network trained with label
smoothing (center panel). The network trained with label smoothing is "automatically calibrated"
and changing the temperature degrades both calibration and BLEU score. Finally, in the right panel,
we plot the NLL for both networks, where markers represent the network with label smoothing.
The model trained with hard targets achieves better NLL at all temperature scaling settings. Thus,
label smoothing improves translation quality measured by BLEU score despite worse NLL, and
the difference of BLEU score performance is only partly explained by calibration. Note that the
minimum of ECE for this experiment predicts top BLEU score slightly better than NLL.

Knowledge distillation
In this section, we study how the use of label smoothing to train a teacher network affects the ability
to distill the teacher’s knowledge into a student network. We show that, even when label smoothing
improves the accuracy of the teacher network, teachers trained with label smoothing produce inferior
student networks compared to teachers trained with hard targets. We ﬁrst noticed this effect when
trying to replicate a result in [16]. A non-convolutional teacher is trained on randomly translated
MNIST digits with hard targets and dropout and gets 0.67% test error. Using distillation, this teacher
can be used to train a narrower, unregularized student on untranslated digits to get 0.74% test error. If
we use label smoothing instead of dropout, the teacher trains much faster and does slightly better
(0.59%) but distillation produces a much worse student with 0.91% test error. Something goes
seriously wrong with distillation when the teacher is trained with label smoothing.
In knowledge distillation, we replace the cross-entropy term H(y, p) by the weighted sum (1 −
β)H(y, p) + βH(pt(T), p(T)), where pk(T) and pt
k(T) are the outputs of the student and teacher
after temperature scaling with temperature T, respectively. β controls the balance between two tasks:
ﬁtting the hard-targets and approximating the softened teacher. The temperature can be viewed as a
way to exaggerate the differences between the probabilities of incorrect answers.
Both label smoothing and knowledge distillation involve ﬁtting a model using soft targets. Knowledge
distillation is only useful if it provides an additional gain to the student compared to training the
student with label smoothing, which is simpler to implement since it does not require training a
teacher network. We quantify this gain experimentally. To demonstrate these ideas, we perform an
experiment on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We train a ResNet-56 teacher and we distill to an AlexNet
student. We are interested in four results:
1. the teacher’s accuracy as a function of the label smoothing factor,
2. the student’s baseline accuracy as a function of the label smoothing factor without distillation,
3. the student’s accuracy after distillation with temperature scaling to control the smoothness
of the teacher’s provided targets (teacher trained with hard targets)
4. the student’s accuracy after distillation with ﬁxed temperature (T = 1.0 and teacher trained
with label smoothing to control the smoothness of the teacher’s provided targets)
To compare all solutions using a single smoothness index, we deﬁne the equivalent label smoothing
factor γ which for scenarios 1 and 2 are equal to α. For scenarios 3 and 4, the smoothness index
is γ = E

, which calculates the mass allocated by the teacher
to incorrect examples over the training set. Since the training accuracy is nearly perfect, for all
distillation experiments, we consider only the case where β = 1, i.e., when the targets are the teacher
output and the true labels are ignored.
Fig. 5 shows the results of this distillation experiment. We ﬁrst compare the performance of the
teacher network (blue solid curve, top) and student network (light blue solid, bottom) trained without
distillation. For this particular setup, increasing α improves the teacher’s accuracy up to values of
α = 0.6, while label smoothing slightly degrades the baseline performance of the student networks.

Figure 6: Estimated mutual information evolu-
tion during teacher training.
Next, we distill the teacher trained with hard targets to students using different temperatures, and
calculate the corresponding γ for each temperature (red dashed curve). We observe that all distilled
models outperform the baseline student with label smoothing. Finally, we distill information from
teachers trained with label smoothing α > 0, which have better accuracy (blue dashed curve). The
ﬁgure shows that using these better performing teachers is no better, and sometimes worse, than
training the student directly with label smoothing, as the relative information between logits is
"erased" when the teacher is trained with label smoothing.
To observe how label smoothing “erases" the information contained in the different similarities that
an individual example has to different classes we revisit the visualizations in Fig. 1. Note that we
are interested in the visualization of the examples from the training set, since those are the ones
used for distillation. For a teacher trained with hard targets (α = 0.0), we observe that examples
are distributed in broad clusters, which means that different examples from the same class can have
very different similarities to other classes. For a teacher trained with label smoothing, we observe the
opposite behavior. Label smoothing encourages examples to lie in tight equally separated clusters, so
every example of one class has very similar proximities to examples of the other classes. Therefore, a
teacher with better accuracy is not necessarily the one that distills better.
One way to directly quantify information erasure is to calculate the mutual information between the
input and the logits. Computing mutual information in high dimensions for unknown distributions is
challenging, but here we simplify the problem in several ways. We measure the mutual information
between X and Y , where X is a discrete variable representing the index of the training example and
Y is continuous representing the difference between two logits (out of K classes). The source of
randomness comes from data augmentation and we approximate the distribution of Y as a Gaussian
and we estimate the mean and variance from the examples using Monte Carlo samples. The difference
of the logits y can be written as y = f(d(zx)), where zx is the ﬂattened input image indexed by x,
d(·) is a random data augmentation function (random shifts for example), and f(·) is a trained neural
network with an image as an input and the difference between two logits as output (resulting in a
single dimension real-valued output). The mutual information and its respective approximation are
I(X; Y ) = EX,Y [log(p(y|x)) −log(P
x p(y|x)p(x))] and

samples used to calculate the empirical mean and N is the number of training examples used for
mutual information estimation. Here the mutual information is between 0 and log(N).
Fig. 6 shows the estimated mutual information between a subset (N = 600 from two classes) of
the training examples and the difference of the logits corresponding to these two classes. After
initialization, the mutual information is very small, but as the network is trained, ﬁrst it rapidly
increases then it slowly decreases specially for the network trained with label smoothing. This result
conﬁrms the intuitions from the last sections. As the representations collapse to small clusters of
points, much of the information that could have helped distinguish examples is lost. This results in
lower estimated mutual information and poor distillation for teachers trained with label smoothing.
7

--- Page 8 ---
For later stages of training, mutual information stays slightly above log(2), which corresponds to
the extreme case where all training examples collapse to two separate clusters. In this case, all the
information of the input is discarded except a single bit representing which class the example belongs
to, resulting in no extra information in the teacher’s logits compared to the information in the labels.

Related work
Pereyra et al. [17] showed that label smoothing provides consistent gains across many tasks. That
work also proposed a new regularizer based on penalizing low entropy predictions, which the authors
term “conﬁdence penalty." They show that label smoothing is equivalent to conﬁdence penalty if the
order of the KL divergence between uniform distributions and model’s outputs is reversed. They also
propose to use distributions other than uniform, resulting in unigram label smoothing (see Table 1)
which is advantageous when the output labels’ distribution is not balanced. Label smoothing also
relates to DisturbLabel [18], which can be seen as label dropout, whereas label smoothing is the
marginalized version of label dropout.
Calibration of modern neural networks [15] has been widely investigated for image classiﬁcation,
but calibration of sequence models has been investigated only recently. Ott et al. [19] investigate
the sequence level calibration of machine translation models and conclude they are remarkably well
calibrated. Kumar and Sarawagi [20] investigate calibration of next-token prediction in language
translation. They ﬁnd that calibration of state-of-the-art models can be improved by a parametric
model, resulting in a small increase in BLEU score. However, neither work invesigates the relation
between label smoothing during training and calibration. For speech recognition, Chorowski and
Jaitly [10] investigate the effect of softmax temperature and label smoothing on decoding accuracy.
The authors conclude that both temperature scaling and label smoothing improve word error rates
after beam-search (label smoothing performs best), but the relation between calibration and label
smoothing/temperature scaling is not described.
Although we are unaware of any previous work that shows the adverse effect of label smoothing upon
distillation, Kornblith et al. [21] previously demonstrated that label smoothing impairs the accuracy
of transfer learning, which similarly depends on the presence of non-class-relevant information in
the ﬁnal layers of the network. Additionally, Chelombiev et al. [22] propose an improved mutual
information estimator based on binning and show correlation between compression of softmax layer
representations and generalization, which may explain why networks trained with label smoothing
generalize so well. This relates to the information bottleneck theory [23, 24, 25] that explains
generalization in terms of compression.

Conclusion and future work
Many state-of-the-art models are trained with label smoothing, but the inductive bias provided by
this technique is not well understood. In this work, we have summarized and explained several
behaviors observed while training deep neural networks with label smoothing. We focused on how
label smoothing encourages representations in the penultimate layer to group in tight equally distant
clusters. This emergent property can be visualized in low dimension thanks to a new visualization
scheme that we proposed. Despite having a positive effect on generalization and calibration, label
smoothing can hurt distillation. We explain this effect in terms of erasure of information. With label
smoothing, the model is encouraged to treat each incorrect class as equally probable. With hard targets,
less structure is enforced in later representations, enabling more logit variation across predicted class
and/or across examples. This can be quantiﬁed by estimating mutual information between input
example and output logit and, as we have shown, label smoothing reduces mutual information. This
ﬁnding suggests a new research direction, focusing on the relationship between label smoothing
and the information bottleneck principle, with implications for compression, generalization and
information transfer. Finally, we performed extensive experiments on how label smoothing can
implicitly calibrate model’s predictions. This has big impact on model interpretability, but also, as
we have shown, can be critical for downstream tasks that depend on calibrated likelihoods such as
beam-search.

Experimental details
A.1
AlexNet
The AlexNet architecture was used in the visualization section and in the distillation section. In both
cases, it was trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We split the training set into training and validation
(40k/10k) and results are shown in the validation set. Our implementation is based on the public
available code in 2 and 3 without exponential weight averaging. The mini-batch size is 128 and we
train for 390k iterations with stochastic gradient descent, starting with learning rate 0.1 and droping
by a factor of 10 every 130k steps. We multiply the cross-entropy term by 3 and use weight decay of
0.04 in the last two dense layers. Five different seeds were used for each point shown in the ﬁgure
and we show min/average/max. For visualization of representations of CIFAR-10 a total of 300
examples were used (100 per class). For the distillation results, β is set to 1 so distillation is done
fully with teacher targets. Note that we use the same training procedure for: training the student
without distillation (variable label smoothing), training the student to mimic the teacher trained with
hard targets and temperature scaling, and training the student to mimic the teacher trained with
variable label smoothing. In the end, the only difference is the targets used. Additionally, when
β = 1, the temperature of the teacher is important to soften the targets, but the temperature of the
student ends up to be just a scalar multiplying the logits and can be learned, therefore we set the
student soft-max temperature to 1 for all experiments. For distillation with teacher trained with hard
targets, the temperatures tested were 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 8.0, 12.0 and 16.0. The label smoothing values
used were 0.0 to 0.75 with steps of 0.15.
A.2
ResNet
The ResNet architecture was used in the visualization, calibration and distillation sections. In all
cases, it was trained on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets4. We split the training set into training
and validation (40k/10k) and results are shown in the validation set. Our implementation uses the
public available model in 5. The mini-batch size is 128 and we train for 64k iterations with stochastic
gradient descent with Nesterov momentum of 0.9, starting with learning rate 0.1 and dropping by a
factor of 10 at 32k and 48k steps. We multiply the cross-entropy term by 3 and use weight decay
of 0.0001. Compared to the implementation in tensor2tensor library, we include gradient clipping
of 1.0 and to create a deep network of 56 layers, we set the number of blocks per layer to 9 for the
three blocks. We also set the kernel size to 3 instead of 7 to resemble the original ResNet architecture
for CIFAR-10 dataset. For visualization of representations of CIFAR-100 a total of 300 examples
were used (100 per class). For the calibration experiment, all 10k examples on the validation set were
used to calculate the ECE and reliability diagram. The label smoothing values used when training
the teacher in the distillation section were 0.0 to 0.75 with steps of 0.15. For the mutual information
results we pick the classes "airplane" and "dog", and calculate the mutual information using 300
examples from the training set of each class. To calculate the average logit per example, we use 5
Monte Carlo samples and estimated mutual information is calculated every 4k training steps. For
data augmentation we used random crops and left-right ﬂips as in 6(cifar_image_augmentation).
A.3
Transformer
The Transformer architecture was used in the calibration section. We reuse the public available imple-
mentation by the original authors described in 7. The dataset can be found in 8(TranslateEndeWmt32k
for around 32k tokens). We used the hyper-parameters provided by the authors of original paper
for single GPU training (transformer_base for label smoothing of 0.1, and transformer_ls0 for label
smoothing of 0.0). Compared to the original paper, we train for 300k steps instead of 100k and we do
not use weight averaging of checkpoints. For the calibration experiment, around 10k tokens of the

validation set were used to calculate the ECE and reliability diagram. For calculation of BLEU score
(uncased), we use the full validation set 9.
A.4
Inception-v4
The Inception-v4 architecture was used in the visualization and calibration sections. We reuse a
public implementation of the model which be can found at 10. We modiﬁed this code to use a scale
parameter for the batch normalization layer, as we found it improved performance. We used a batch
size of 4096 and trained the model using stochastic gradient descent with Nesterov momentum of
0.9 and weight decay of 8 × 10−5. We took an exponential average of the weights with decay factor
0.9999, and selected the checkpoint that achieved the maximum accuracy during a separate training
run where approximately 50,000 images from the ImageNet training set were used for validation.
A.5
Fully-connected
For the distillation results on MNIST we use fully connected networks with 2 layers. 1200 neurons
per layer is used on the teacher and 800 layers in the student. For training the teacher, we use α = 0.1,
random image shifts of plus or minus 2 pixels in both x and y axis (i.e. 25 equiprobable centerings
for each case). The initialization distribution is Gaussian with variance 0.03. Learning rate is set
1, except for last layer which is set to 0.1. We used gradient smoothing corresponding to 0.9 times
previous gradient plus 0.1 the current one. Finally the learning rate drops linearly to 0 after 100
epochs and no weight decay is used. For training the student during distillation, no data augmentation
is used. We used β = 0.6, so the original cross-entropy with hard-targets is multiplied by 0.4 and we
match the teacher logits with half the squared loss multiplied by 0.6. Note that optimizing for the
squared loss is equivalent to picking a high temperature.
B
Penultimate layer representation for translation
Below, we show visualizations for the English-to-German translation task. The results are similar
to the previous image classiﬁcation visualization results. Next-token prediction is equivalent to
classiﬁcation. In image classiﬁcation we maximize the likelihood p(y|x) of the correct class given an
image, whereas in translation, we maximize the likelihood p(yt|x, y0:t−1) of next token given source
sentence and preceding target sequence. However, there are differences between the tasks that affect
visualization and distillation.
• The image classiﬁcation datasets we examine have balanced class distributions, whereas token
distributions in translation are highly imbalanced. (This could potentially be addressed with
unigram label smoothing.)
• For image classiﬁcation, we can get near-perfect training set accuracy and still generalize (interpo-
lation regime); in this case, label smoothing erases information, whereas hard-targets preserves
it. In the translation task, next-token accuracy on the training set is around 80%. Therefore,
visualizations show errors in both the training and validation sets (tending to tight clusters as
expected). For distillation, this means a student may learn from the teacher’s errors. Since teachers
trained with and without label smoothing will both have errors that the student can learn from, it is
unclear which will perform best.
• For image classiﬁcation, the penultimate layer dimension is usually higher than the number of
classes, so templates can lie on a regular simplex (i.e. equidistant to each other). In translation, we
have a ~30k token alphabet in 512 dimensions, so a simplex is not possible.
In this work, for visualization and distillation, we concentrate on the image classiﬁcation case to
simplify intuition and experimental design. The visualization results below demonstrate that some
features of the image classiﬁcation visualization also hold for translation. We leave analysis of
distillation for translation for future work.
