Abstract
Recent work has shown that data augmentation has the
potential to signiﬁcantly improve the generalization of deep
learning models. Recently, automated augmentation strate-
gies have led to state-of-the-art results in image classiﬁca-
tion and object detection. While these strategies were op-
timized for improving validation accuracy, they also led to
state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised learning and im-
proved robustness to common corruptions of images. An
obstacle to a large-scale adoption of these methods is a sep-
arate search phase which increases the training complex-
ity and may substantially increase the computational cost.
Additionally, due to the separate search phase, these ap-
proaches are unable to adjust the regularization strength
based on model or dataset size. Automated augmentation
policies are often found by training small models on small
datasets and subsequently applied to train larger models.
In this work, we remove both of these obstacles. RandAug-
ment has a signiﬁcantly reduced search space which allows
it to be trained on the target task with no need for a separate
proxy task. Furthermore, due to the parameterization, the
regularization strength may be tailored to different model
and dataset sizes.
RandAugment can be used uniformly
across different tasks and datasets and works out of the box,
matching or surpassing all previous automated augmenta-
tion approaches on CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, and ImageNet.
On the ImageNet dataset we achieve 85.0% accuracy, a
0.6% increase over the previous state-of-the-art and 1.0%
increase over baseline augmentation. On object detection,
RandAugment leads to 1.0-1.3% improvement over base-
line augmentation, and is within 0.3% mAP of AutoAugment
on COCO. Finally, due to its interpretable hyperparameter,
RandAugment may be used to investigate the role of data
augmentation with varying model and dataset size. Code is
available online. 1

1. Introduction
Data augmentation is a widely used method for gen-
erating additional data to improve machine learning sys-
tems, for image classiﬁcation [43, 23, 7, 54], object detec-
tion [13], instance segmentation [10], and speech recogni-
tion [21, 16, 36]. Unfortunately, data augmentation meth-
ods require expertise, and manual work to design policies
that capture prior knowledge in each domain. This require-
ment makes it difﬁcult to extend existing data augmentation
methods to other applications and domains.
Learning policies for data augmentation has recently
emerged as a method to automate the design of augmen-
tation strategies and therefore has the potential to address
some weaknesses of traditional data augmentation methods
[5, 57, 20, 25]. Training a machine learning model with
a learned data augmentation policy may signiﬁcantly im-
prove accuracy [5], model robustness [32, 52, 41], and per-
formance on semi-supervised learning [50] for image clas-
siﬁcation; likewise, for object detection tasks on COCO
and PASCAL-VOC [57]. Notably, unlike engineering bet-

ter network architectures [59], all of these improvements in
predictive performance incur no additional computational
cost at inference time.
In spite of the beneﬁts of learned data augmentation poli-
cies, the computational requirements as well as the added
complexity of two separate optimization procedures can be
prohibitive. The original presentation of neural architecture
search (NAS) realized an analogous scenario in which the
dual optimization procedure resulted in superior predictive
performance, but the original implementation proved pro-
hibitive in terms of complexity and computational demand.
Subsequent work accelerated training efﬁciency and the ef-
ﬁcacy of the procedure [30, 38, 28, 29], eventually making
the method amenable to a uniﬁed optimization based on a
differentiable process [30]. In the case of learned augmen-
tations, subsequent work identiﬁed more efﬁcient search
methods [20, 25], however such methods still require a sep-
arate optimization procedure, which signiﬁcantly increases
the computational cost and complexity of training a ma-
chine learning model.
The original formulation for automated data augmenta-
tion postulated a separate search on a small, proxy task
whose results may be transferred to a larger target task
[59, 58]. This formulation makes a strong assumption that
the proxy task provides a predictive indication of the larger
task [28, 2]. In the case of learned data augmentation, we
provide experimental evidence to challenge this core as-
sumption. In particular, we demonstrate that this strategy
is sub-optimal as the strength of the augmentation depends
strongly on model and dataset size. These results suggest
that an improved data augmentation may be possible if one
could remove the separate search phase on a proxy task.
In this work, we propose a practical method for auto-
mated data augmentation – termed RandAugment
– that
does not require a separate search. In order to remove a sep-
arate search, we ﬁnd it necessary to dramatically reduce the
search space for data augmentation. The reduction in pa-
rameter space is in fact so dramatic that simple grid search
is sufﬁcient to ﬁnd a data augmentation policy that outper-
forms all learned augmentation methods that employ a sep-
arate search phase. Our contributions can be summarized as
follows:
• We demonstrate that the optimal strength of a data aug-
mentation depends on the model size and training set
size. This observation indicates that a separate opti-
mization of an augmentation policy on a smaller proxy
task may be sub-optimal for learning and transferring
augmentation policies.
• We introduce a vastly simpliﬁed search space for
data augmentation containing 2 interpretable hyper-
parameters. One may employ simple grid search to
tailor the augmentation policy to a model and dataset,
removing the need for a separate search process.
• Leveraging this formulation, we demonstrate state-of-
the-art results on CIFAR [22], SVHN [34], and Im-
ageNet [6]. On object detection [27], our method is
within 0.3% mAP of state-of-the-art. On ImageNet we
achieve a state-of-the-art accuracy of 85.0%, a 0.6%
increment over previous methods and 1.0% over base-
line augmentation.
2. Related Work
Data augmentation has played a central role in the train-
ing of deep vision models. On natural images, horizon-
tal ﬂips and random cropping or translations of the images
are commonly used in classiﬁcation and detection mod-
els [53, 23, 13]. On MNIST, elastic distortions across scale,
position, and orientation have been applied to achieve im-
pressive results [43, 4, 49, 42]. While previous examples
augment the data while keeping it in the training set dis-
tribution, operations that do the opposite can also be effec-
tive in increasing generalization. Some methods randomly
erase or add noise to patches of images for increased valida-
tion accuracy [8, 55], robustness [46, 52, 11], or both [32].
Mixup [54] is a particularly effective augmentation method
on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, where the neural network is
trained on convex combinations of images and their corre-
sponding labels. Object-centric cropping is commonly used
for object detection tasks [31], whereas [9] adds new objects
on training images by cut-and-paste.
Moving away from individual operations to augment
data, other work has focused on ﬁnding optimal strategies
for combining different operations.
For example, Smart
Augmentation learns a network that merges two or more
samples from the same class to generate new data [24]. Tran
et al. generate augmented data via a Bayesian approach,
based on the distribution learned from the training set [48].
DeVries et al.
use transformations (e.g.
noise, interpo-
lations and extrapolations) in the learned feature space to
augment data [7]. Furthermore, generative adversarial net-
works (GAN) have been used to choose optimal sequences
of data augmentation operations[39]. GANs have also been
used to generate training data directly [37, 33, 56, 1, 44],
however this approach does not seem to be as beneﬁcial as
learning sequences of data augmentation operations that are
pre-deﬁned [40].
Another approach to learning data augmentation strate-
gies from data is AutoAugment [5], which originally used
reinforcement learning to choose a sequence of operations
as well as their probability of application and magnitude.
Application of AutoAugment policies involves stochasticity
at multiple levels: 1) for every image in every minibatch,
a sub-policy is chosen with uniform probability. 2) oper-
ations in each sub-policy has an associated probability of

these examples N=2 and three magnitudes are shown corre-
sponding to the optimal distortion magnitudes for ResNet-50,
EfﬁcientNet-B5 and EfﬁcientNet-B7, respectively.
As the dis-
tortion magnitude increases, the strength of the augmentation in-
creases.
application. 3) Some operations have stochasticity over di-
rection. For example, an image can be rotated clockwise or
counter-clockwise. The layers of stochasticity increase the
amount of diversity that the network is trained on, which in
turn was found to signiﬁcantly improve generalization on
many datasets. More recently, several papers used the Au-
toAugment search space and formalism with improved op-
timization algorithms to ﬁnd AutoAugment policies more
efﬁciently [20, 25]. Although the time it takes to search
for policies has been reduced signiﬁcantly, having to imple-
ment these methods in a separate search phase reduces the
applicability of AutoAugment. For this reason, this work
aims to eliminate the search phase on a separate proxy task
completely.
Some of the developments in RandAugment were in-
spired by the recent improvements to searching over data
augmentation policies.
For example, Population Based
Augmentation (PBA) [20] found that the optimal magnitude
of augmentations increased during the course of training,
which inspired us to not search over optimal magnitudes for
each transformation but have a ﬁxed magnitude schedule,
which we discuss in detail in Section 3. Furthermore, au-
thors of Fast AutoAugment [25] found that a data augmen-
tation policy that is trained for density matching leads to
improved generalization accuracy, which inspired our ﬁrst
order differentiable term for improving augmentation (see
Section 4.7).

3. Methods
The primary goal of RandAugment is to remove the need
for a separate search phase on a proxy task. The reason
we wish to remove the search phase is because a separate
search phase signiﬁcantly complicates training and is com-
putationally expensive. More importantly, the proxy task
may provide sub-optimal results (see Section 4.1). In or-
der to remove a separate search phase, we aspire to fold
the parameters for the data augmentation strategy into the
hyper-parameters for training a model. Given that previ-
ous learned augmentation methods contained 30+ parame-
ters [5, 25, 20], we focus on vastly reducing the parameter
space for data augmentation.
Previous work indicates that the main beneﬁt of learned
augmentation policies arise from increasing the diversity of
examples [5, 20, 25]. Indeed, previous work enumerated a
policy in terms of choosing which transformations to apply
out of K=14 available transformations, and probabilities for
applying each transformation:
• identity
• autoContrast
• equalize
• rotate
• solarize
• color
• posterize
• contrast
• brightness
• sharpness
• shear-x
• shear-y
• translate-x
• translate-y
In order to reduce the parameter space but still maintain im-
age diversity, we replace the learned policies and probabili-
ties for applying each transformation with a parameter-free
procedure of always selecting a transformation with uni-
form probability 1
K . Given N transformations for a training
image, RandAugment may thus express KN potential poli-
cies.
The ﬁnal set of parameters to consider is the magnitude
of the each augmentation distortion. Following [5], we em-
ploy the same linear scale for indicating the strength of each
transformation. Brieﬂy, each transformation resides on an

--- Page 4 ---
integer scale from 0 to 10 where a value of 10 indicates
the maximum scale for a given transformation. A data aug-
mentation policy consists of identifying an integer for each
augmentation [5, 25, 20]. In order to reduce the parame-
ter space further, we observe that the learned magnitude for
each transformation follows a similar schedule during train-
ing (e.g. Figure 4 in [20]) and postulate that a single global
distortion M may sufﬁce for parameterizing all transforma-
tions. We experimented with four methods for the schedule
of M during training: constant magnitude, random magni-
tude, a linearly increasing magnitude, and a random magni-
tude with increasing upper bound. The details of this exper-
iment can be found in Appendix A.1.1.
The resulting algorithm contains two parameters N and
M and may be expressed simply in two lines of Python
code (Figure 2). Both parameters are human-interpretable
such that larger values of N and M increase regulariza-
tion strength. Standard methods may be employed to efﬁ-
ciently perform hyperparameter optimization [45, 14], how-
ever given the extremely small search space we ﬁnd that
naive grid search is quite effective (Section 4.1). We justify
all of the choices of this proposed algorithm in this subse-
quent sections by comparing the efﬁcacy of the learned aug-
mentations to all previous learned data augmentation meth-
ods.
4. Results
To explore the space of data augmentations, we exper-
iment with core image classiﬁcation and object detection
tasks. In particular, we focus on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
SVHN, and ImageNet datasets as well as COCO object de-
tection so that we may compare with previous work. For all
of these datasets, we replicate the corresponding architec-
tures and set of data transformations. Our goal is to demon-
strate the relative beneﬁts of employing this method over
previous learned augmentation methods.
4.1. Systematic failures of a separate proxy task
A central premise of learned data augmentation is to con-
struct a small, proxy task that may be reﬂective of a larger
task [58, 59, 5]. Although this assumption is sufﬁcient for
identifying learned augmentation policies to improve per-
formance [5, 57, 36, 25, 20], it is unclear if this assumption
is overly stringent and may lead to sub-optimal data aug-
mentation policies.
In this ﬁrst section, we challenge the hypothesis that for-
mulating the problem in terms of a small proxy task is ap-
propriate for learned data augmentation. In particular, we
explore this question along two separate dimensions that are
commonly restricted to achieve a small proxy task: model
size and dataset size. To explore this hypothesis, we sys-
tematically measure the effects of data augmentation poli-
cies on CIFAR-10. First, we train a family of Wide-ResNet

architectures [53], where the model size may be system-
atically altered through the widening parameter governing
the number of convolutional ﬁlters. For each of these net-
works, we train the model on CIFAR-10 and measure the
ﬁnal accuracy compared to a baseline model trained with
default data augmentations (i.e. ﬂip left-right and random
translations). The Wide-ResNet models are trained with the
additional K=14 data augmentations (see Methods) over a
range of global distortion magnitudes M parameterized on
a uniform linear scale ranging from [0, 30] 2.
Figure 3a demonstrates the relative gain in accuracy of
a model trained across increasing distortion magnitudes for
three Wide-ResNet models. The squares indicate the dis-
tortion magnitude with which achieves the highest accu-
racy. Note that in spite of the measurement noise, Figure
3a demonstrates systematic trends across distortion magni-
tudes. In particular, plotting all Wide-ResNet architectures
versus the optimal distortion magnitude highlights a clear
monotonic trend across increasing network sizes (Figure
3b). Namely, larger networks demand larger data distor-
tions for regularization. Figure 1 highlights the visual dif-
ference in the optimal distortion magnitude for differently
sized models. Conversely, a learned policy based on [5]
provides a ﬁxed distortion magnitude (Figure 3b, dashed
line) for all architectures that is clearly sub-optimal.

a value of 10 to maintain comparable results.

is to train the proxy on a small subset of the training
data.
Figure 3c demonstrates the relative gain in accu-
racy of Wide-ResNet-28-10 trained across increasing dis-
tortion magnitudes for varying amounts of CIFAR-10 train-
ing data. The squares indicate the distortion magnitude with
that achieves the highest accuracy. Note that in spite of
the measurement noise, Figure 3c demonstrates systematic
trends across distortion magnitudes. We ﬁrst observe that
models trained on smaller training sets may gain more im-
provement from data augmentation (e.g. 3.0% versus 1.5%
in Figure 3c). Furthermore, we see that the optimal distor-
tion magnitude is larger for models that are trained on larger
datasets. At ﬁrst glance, this may disagree with the expec-
tation that smaller datasets require stronger regularization.
Figure 3d demonstrates that the optimal distortion mag-
nitude increases monotonically with training set size. One
hypothesis for this counter-intuitive behavior is that aggres-
sive data augmentation leads to a low signal-to-noise ratio
in small datasets. Regardless, this trend highlights the need
for increasing the strength of data augmentation on larger
datasets and the shortcomings of optimizing learned aug-
mentation policies on a proxy task comprised of a subset of
the training data. Namely, the learned augmentation may
learn an augmentation strength more tailored to the proxy
task instead of the larger task of interest.
The dependence of augmentation strength on the dataset
and model size indicate that a small proxy task may provide
a sub-optimal indicator of performance on a larger task.
This empirical result suggests that a distinct strategy may
be necessary for ﬁnding an optimal data augmentation pol-
icy. In particular, we propose in this work to focus on a
uniﬁed optimization of the model weights and data augmen-
tation policy. Figure 3 suggest that merely searching for a
shared distortion magnitude M across all transformations
may provide sufﬁcient gains that exceed learned optimiza-
tion methods [5]. Additionally, we see that optimizing in-
dividual magnitudes further leads to minor improvement in
performance (see Section A.1.2 in Appendix).
Furthermore, Figure 3a and 3c indicate that merely sam-
pling a few distortion magnitudes is sufﬁcient to achieve
good results.
Coupled with a second free parameter N,
we consider these results to prescribe an algorithm for
learning an augmentation policy. In the subsequent sec-
tions, we identify two free parameters N and M specify-
ing RandAugment through a minimal grid search and com-
pare these results against computationally-heavy learned

data augmentations based on proxy tasks.
4.2. CIFAR
CIFAR-10 has been extensively studied with previous
data augmentation methods and we ﬁrst test this proposed
method on this data.
The default augmentations for all
methods include ﬂips, pad-and-crop and Cutout [8]. N and
M were selected based on the validation performance on 5K
held out examples from the training set for 1 and 5 settings
for N and M, respectively. Results indicate that RandAug-
ment achieves either competitive (i.e. within 0.1%) or state-
of-the-art on CIFAR-10 across four network architectures
(Table 2). As a more challenging task, we additionally com-
pare the efﬁcacy of RandAugment on CIFAR-100 for Wide-
ResNet-28-2 and Wide-ResNet-28-10. On the held out 5K
dataset, we sampled 2 and 4 settings for N and M, respec-
tively (i.e. N={1, 2} and M={2, 6, 10, 14}). For Wide-
ResNet-28-2 and Wide-ResNet-28-10, we ﬁnd that N=1,
M=2 and N=2, M=14 achieves best results, respectively.
Again, RandAugment achieves competitive or superior re-
sults across both architectures (Table 2).
4.3. SVHN
Because SVHN is composed of numbers instead of nat-
ural images, the data augmentation strategy for SVHN may
differ substantially from CIFAR-10. Indeed, [5] identiﬁed
a qualitatively different policy for CIFAR-10 than SVHN.
Likewise, in a semi-supervised setting for CIFAR-10, a pol-
icy learned from CIFAR-10 performs better than a policy
learned from SVHN [50].
SVHN has a core training set of 73K images [34]. In
addition, SVHN contains 531K less difﬁcult “extra” im-
ages to augment training. We compare the performance of
the augmentation methods on SVHN with and without the
extra data on Wide-ResNet-28-2 and Wide-ResNet-28-10
(Table 2). In spite of the large differences between SVHN
and CIFAR, RandAugment consistently matches or outper-
forms previous methods with no alteration to the list of
transformations employed. Notably, for Wide-ResNet-28-
2, applying RandAugment to the core training dataset im-
proves performance more than augmenting with 531K ad-
ditional training images (98.3% vs. 98.2%). For, Wide-
ResNet-28-10, RandAugment is competitive with augment-
ing the core training set with 531K training images (i.e.
within 0.2%). Nonetheless, Wide-ResNet-28-10 with Ran-
dAugment matches the previous state-of-the-art accuracy
on SVHN which used a more advanced model [5].
4.4. ImageNet
Data augmentation methods that improve CIFAR-10 and
SVHN models do not always improve large-scale tasks such
as ImageNet. For instance, Cutout substantially improves
CIFAR and SVHN performance [8], but fails to improve
ImageNet [32]. Likewise, AutoAugment does not increase
the performance on ImageNet as much as other tasks [5],
especially for large networks (e.g. +0.4% for AmoebaNet-
C [5] and +0.1% for EfﬁcientNet-B5 [47]). One plausible
reason for the lack of strong gains is that the small proxy
task was particularly impoverished by restricting the task to
∼10% of the 1000 ImageNet classes.
Table 3 compares the performance of RandAugment to
other learned augmentation approaches on ImageNet. Ran-
dAugment matches the performance of AutoAugment and
Fast AutoAugment on the smallest model (ResNet-50), but
on larger models RandAugment signiﬁcantly outperforms
other methods achieving increases of up to +1.3% above
the baseline. For instance, on EfﬁcientNet-B7, the resulting
model achieves 85.0% – a new state-of-the-art accuracy –
exhibiting a 1.0% improvement over the baseline augmen-
tation. These systematic gains are similar to the improve-
ments achieved with engineering new architectures [59, 28],
however these gains arise without incurring additional com-
putational cost at inference time.
4.5. COCO
To further test the generality of this approach, we next
explore a related task of large-scale object detection on the
COCO dataset [27]. Learned augmentation policies have
improved object detection and lead to state-of-the-art results
[57]. We followed previous work by training on the same
architectures and following the same training schedules (see
Appendix A.3). Brieﬂy, we employed RetinaNet [26] with
ResNet-101 and ResNet-200 as a backbone [17]. Models
were trained for 300 epochs from random initialization.
Table 4 compares results between a baseline model, Au-
toAugment and RandAugment.
AutoAugment leveraged
additional, specialized transformations not afforded to Ran-
dAugment in order to augment the localized bounding box
of an image [57].
In addition, note that AutoAugment
expended ∼15K GPU hours for search, where as Ran-
dAugment was tuned by on merely 6 values of the hyper-
parameters (see Appendix A.3). In spite of the smaller li-
brary of specialized transformations and the lack of a sep-
arate search phase, RandAugment surpasses the baseline
model and provides competitive accuracy with AutoAug-
ment. We reserve for future work to expand the transforma-
tion library to include bounding box speciﬁc transformation
to potentially improve RandAugment results even further.
4.6. Investigating the dependence on the included
transformations
RandAugment achieves state-of-the-art results across
different tasks and datasets using the same list of transfor-

insensitive to the selection of transformations for differ-

mented with RandAugment on a Wide-ResNet-28-2 trained
on CIFAR-10 for randomly sampled subsets of the full list
of 14 transformations. We did not use ﬂips, pad-and-crop,
or cutout to only focus on the improvements due to Ran-
dAugment with random subsets. Figure 4a suggests that the
median validation accuracy due to RandAugment improves
as the number of transformations is increased. However,
even with only two transformations, RandAugment leads to
more than 1% improvement in validation accuracy on aver-
age.
To get a sense for the effect of individual transforma-
tions, we calculate the average improvement in validation
accuracy for each transformation when they are added to a
random subset of transformations. We list the transforma-
tions in order of most helpful to least helpful in Table 5. We
see that while geometric transformations individually make
the most difference, some of the color transformations lead
to a degradation of validation accuracy on average. Note
that while Table 5 shows the average effect of adding in-
dividual transformations to randomly sampled subsets of
transformations, Figure 4a shows that including all trans-
formations together leads to a good result. The transfor-
mation rotate is most helpful on average, which was also
observed previously [5, 57]. To see the effect of represen-
tative transformations in more detail, we repeat the anal-
ysis in Figure 4a for subsets with and without (rotate,
translate-x, and posterize). Surprisingly, rotate can
signiﬁcantly improve performance and lower variation even
when included in small subsets of RandAugment transfor-
mations, while posterize seems to hurt all subsets of all
sizes.
4.7. Learning the probabilities for selecting image
transformations
RandAugment selects all image transformations with
equal probability. This opens up the question of whether
learning K probabilities may improve performance further.
Most of the image transformations (except posterize, equal-
ize, and autoContrast) are differentiable, which permits back-
propagation to learn the K probabilities [30]. Let us denote
αij as the learned probability of selecting image transfor-
mation i for operation j. For K=14 image transformations
and N=2 operations, αij constitutes 28 parameters. We ini-
tialize all weights such that each transformation is equal
probability (i.e. RandAugment), and update these param-
eters based on how well a model classiﬁes a held out set of

validation images distorted by αij. This approach was in-
spired by density matching [25], but instead uses a differen-
tiable approach in lieu of Bayesian optimization. We label
this method as a 1st-order density matching approximation.
To test the efﬁcacy of density matching to learn the prob-
abilities of each transformation, we trained Wide-ResNet-
28-2 and Wide-ResNet-28-10 on CIFAR-10 and the reduced
form of CIFAR-10 containing 4K training samples.
Ta-
ble 6 indicates that learning the probabilities αij slightly
improves performance on reduced and full CIFAR-10 (RA
vs 1st). The 1st-order method improves accuracy by more
than 3.0% for both models on reduced CIFAR-10 compared
to the baseline of ﬂips and pad-and-crop. On CIFAR-10, the
1st-order method improves accuracy by 0.9% on the smaller
model and 1.2% on the larger model compared to the base-
line. We further see that the 1st-order method always per-
forms better than RandAugment, with the largest improve-
ment on Wide-ResNet-28-10 trained on reduced CIFAR-10
(87.4% vs. 86.8%). On CIFAR-10, the 1st-order method
outperforms AutoAugment on Wide-ResNet-28-2 (96.1%
vs. 95.9%) and matches AutoAugment on Wide-ResNet-

ing, this method can be expensive as one must apply all
K transformations N times to each image independently.
Hence, because the computational demand of KN transfor-
mations is prohibitive for large images, we reserve this for
future exploration. In summary, we take these results to in-
dicate that learning the probabilities through density match-
ing may improve the performance on small-scale tasks and
reserve explorations to larger-scale tasks for the future.
5. Discussion
Data augmentation is a necessary method for achieving
state-of-the-art performance [43, 23, 7, 54, 13, 36]. Learned
data augmentation strategies have helped automate the de-
sign of such strategies and likewise achieved state-of-the-
art results [5, 25, 20, 57]. In this work, we demonstrated
that previous methods of learned augmentation suffers from
systematic drawbacks. Namely, not tailoring the number of
distortions and the distortion magnitude to the dataset size
nor the model size leads to sub-optimal performance. To
remedy this situation, we propose a simple parameterization
for targeting augmentation to particular model and dataset
sizes. We demonstrate that RandAugment is competitive
with or outperforms previous approaches [5, 25, 20, 57]
on CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, ImageNet and COCO without
a separate search for data augmentation policies.
In previous work, scaling learned data augmentation to
larger dataset and models have been a notable obstacle.
For example, AutoAugment and Fast AutoAugment could
only be optimized for small models on reduced subsets of
data [5, 25]; population based augmentation was not re-
ported for large-scale problems [20]. The proposed method
scales quite well to datasets such as ImageNet and COCO
while incurring minimal computational cost (e.g. 2 hyper-
parameters), but notable predictive performance gains. An
open question remains how this method may improve model
robustness [32, 52, 41] or semi-supervised learning [50].
Future work will study how this method applies to other ma-
chine learning domains, where data augmentation is known
to improve predictive performance, such as image segmen-
tation [3], 3-D perception [35], speech recognition [19] or
audio recognition [18]. In particular, we wish to better un-
derstand if or when datasets or tasks may require a separate
search phase to achieve optimal performance. Finally, an
open question remains how one may tailor the set of trans-
formations to a given tasks in order to further improve the
predictive performance of a given model.
learn αij based on differentiating through a virtual training step [30]. In
this approach, the 2nd-order approximation yielded consistently negative
results (see Appendix A.1).

A. Appendix
A.1. Second order term from bilevel optimization
For the second order term for the optimization of aug-
mentation parameters, we follow the formulation in [30],
which we summarize below. We treat the optimization of
augmentation parameters and weights of the neural network
as a bilevel optimization problem, where α are the augmen-
tation parameters and w are the weights of the neural net-
work. Then the goal is to ﬁnd the optimal augmentation
parameters α such that when weights are optimized on the
training set using data augmentation given by α parameters,
the validation loss is minimized. In other words:
minαLval(w∗(α), α) s.t. w∗(α) =
argminw Ltrain(w, α).
(1)
Then, again following [30], we approximate this bilevel op-
timization by a single virtual training step,
∇αLval(w∗(α), α) ≈
∇αLval(w −ξ∇wLtrain(w, α), α),
(2)
where ξ is the virtual learning rate. Eq. 2 can be expanded
as
∇αLval(w∗(α), α) ≈
∇αLval(w −ξ∇wLtrain(w, α), α) −
ξ∇2
α,wLtrain(w, α)∇w′Lval(w′, α),
(3)
where w′ = w −ξ∇wLtrain(w, α). In the case where
the virtual learning rate, ξ, is zero, the second term disap-
pears and the ﬁrst term becomes ∇Lval(w, α), which was
called the ﬁrst-order approximation [30]. This ﬁrst-order
approximation was found to be highly signiﬁcant for archi-
tecture search, where most of the improvement (0.3% out of
0.5%) could be achieved using this approximation in a more
efﬁcient manner (1.5 days as opposed to 4 days). Unfortu-
nately, when α represents augmentation parameters, ﬁrst-
order approximation is irrelevant since the predictions of a
model on the clean validation images do not depend on the
augmentation parameters α. Then we are left with just the
second order approximation, where ξ > 0, which we ap-
proximate via ﬁnite difference approximation as
∇2
α,wLtrain(w, α)∇w′Lval(w′, α) ≈
∇αLtrain(w+, α) −∇αLtrain(w−, α)
2ϵ
,
(4)
where w± = w±ϵ∇w′Lval(w′, α) and ϵ is a small number.

Table 7. Results for different ways of setting the global magni-
tude parameter M. All magnitude methods were run on CIFAR-
10 with Wide-ResNet-28-10 for 200 epochs. The reported accu-
racy is the average of 10 runs on the validation set for the best
hyperparamter setting for that magnitude method. All magnitude
methods searched over had 48 different hyperparameter settings
tried.
Figure 5. Performance when magnitude is changed for one im-
age transformation. This plot uses a shared magnitude for all
image transformations and then changes the magnitude of only
one operation while keeping the others ﬁxed. Two different archi-
tectures were tried (WRN-28-2 and WRN-28-10) and two differ-
ent image transformations were changed (Rotate and TranslateX),
which results in the 4 lines shown. Twenty different magnitudes
were tried for the selected transformation ([0 −19]). The squares
indicate the optimal magnitude found and the diamonds indicate
the magnitude used for all other transformations (4 for WRN-28-2
and 5 for WRN-28-10).
during the course of training. A linearly increasing mag-
nitude interpolates the distortion magnitude during training
between two values. A random magnitude with increasing
upper bound is similar to a random magnitude, but the upper
bound is increased linearly during training. In preliminary
experiments, we found that all strategies worked equally
well. Thus, we selected a constant magnitude because this
strategy includes only a single hyper-parameter, and we em-
ploy this for the rest of the work. The results from our ex-
periment on trying the different magnitude strategies can be
see in Table 7.

Optimizing individual transformation magni-
tudes
Figure 5 demonstrates that changing the magnitude for one
transformation, when keeping the rest ﬁxed results in a very
minor accuracy change. This suggests that tying all magni-
tudes together into a single value M is not greatly hurting
the model performance. Across all for settings in Figure 5
the difference in accuracy of the tied magnitude vs the opti-
mal one found was 0.19% 0.18% for the rotation operation
experiments and 0.07% 0.05% for the TranslateX experi-
ments. Changing one transformation does not have a huge
impact on performance, which leads us to think that tying
all magnitude parameters together is a sensible approach
that drastically reduces the size of the search-space.
A.2. Experimental Details
A.2.1
CIFAR
The Wide-ResNet models were trained for 200 epochs with
a learning rate of 0.1, batch size of 128, weight decay of 5e-
4, and cosine learning rate decay. Shake-Shake [12] model
was trained for 1800 epochs with a learning rate of 0.01,
batch size of 128, weight decay of 1e-3, and cosine learning
rate decay. ShakeDrop [51] models were trained for 1800
epochs with a learning rate of 0.05, batch size of 64 (as
128 did not ﬁt on a single GPU), weight decay of 5e-5, and
cosine learning rate decay.
On CIFAR-10, we used 3 for the number of operations
applied (N) and tried 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11 for magnitude. For
Wide-ResNet-2 and Wide-ResNet-10, we ﬁnd that the op-
timal magnitude is 4 and 5, respectively. For Shake-Shake
(26 2x96d) and PyramidNet + ShakeDrop models, the opti-
mal magnitude was 9 and 7, respectively.
A.2.2
SVHN
For both SVHN datasets, we applied cutout after RandAug-
ment as was done for AutoAugment and related methods.
On core SVHN, for both Wide-ResNet-28-2 and Wide-
ResNet-28-10, we used a learning rate of 5e-3, weight de-
cay of 5e-3, and cosine learning rate decay for 200 epochs.
We set N = 3 and tried 5, 7, 9, and 11 for magnitude. For
both Wide-ResNet-28-2 and Wide-ResNet-28-10, we ﬁnd
the optimal magnitude to be 9.
On full SVHN, for both Wide-ResNet-28-2 and Wide-
ResNet-28-10, we used a learning rate of 5e-3, weight de-
cay of 1e-3, and cosine learning rate decay for 160 epochs.
We set N = 3 and tried 5, 7, 9, and 11 for magnitude. For
Wide-ResNet-28-2, we ﬁnd the optimal magnitude to be 5;
whereas for Wide-ResNet-28-10, we ﬁnd the optimal mag-
nitude to be 7.
A.2.3
ImageNet
The ResNet models were trained for 180 epochs using the
standard ResNet-50 training hyperparameters. The image
size was 224 by 244, the weight decay was 0.0001 and the
momentum optimizer with a momentum parameter of 0.9
was used. The learning rate was 0.1, which gets scaled by
the batch size divided by 256. A global batch size of 4096
was used, split across 32 workers. For ResNet-50 the opti-
mal distortion magnitude was 9 and (N = 2). The distor-
tion magnitudes we tried were 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and the
values of N that were tried were 1, 2 and 3.
The EfﬁcientNet experiments used the default hyper pa-
rameters and training schedule, which can be found in [47].
We trained for 350 epochs, used a batch size of 4096 split
across 256 replicas. The learning rate was 0.016, which gets
scaled by the batch size divided by 256. We used the RM-
SProp optimizer with a momentum rate of 0.9, epsilon of
0.001 and a decay of 0.9. The weight decay used was 1e-5.
For EfﬁcientNet B5 the image size was 456 by 456 and for
EfﬁcientNet B7 it was 600 by 600. For EfﬁcientNet B5 we
tried N = 2 and N = 3 and found them to perform about
the same. We found the optimal distortion magnitude for
B5 to be 17. The different magnitudes we tried were 8, 11,
14, 17, 21. For EfﬁcientNet B7 we used N = 2 and found
the optimal distortion magnitude to be 28. The magnitudes
tried were 17, 25, 28, 31.
The default augmentation of horizontal ﬂipping and ran-
dom crops were used on ImageNet, applied before Ran-
dAugment. The standard training and validation splits were
employed for training and evaluation.
A.3. COCO
We applied horizontal ﬂipping and scale jitters in addi-
tion to RandAugment. We used the same list of data aug-
mentation transformations as we did in all other classiﬁca-
tion tasks. Geometric operations transformed the bounding
boxes the way it was deﬁned in Ref. [57]. We used a learn-
ing rate of 0.08 and a weight decay of 1e 4. The focal loss
parameters are set to be α = 0.25 and γ = 1.5. We set
N = 1 and tried distortion magnitudes between 4 and 9.
We found the optimal distortion magnitude for ResNet-101
and ResNet-200 to be 5 and 6, respectively.
