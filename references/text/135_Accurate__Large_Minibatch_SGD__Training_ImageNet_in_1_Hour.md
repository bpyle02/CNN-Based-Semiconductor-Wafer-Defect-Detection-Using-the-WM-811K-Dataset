Abstract
Deep learning thrives with large neural networks and
large datasets.
However, larger networks and larger
datasets result in longer training times that impede re-
search and development progress. Distributed synchronous
SGD offers a potential solution to this problem by dividing
SGD minibatches over a pool of parallel workers. Yet to
make this scheme efﬁcient, the per-worker workload must
be large, which implies nontrivial growth in the SGD mini-
batch size. In this paper, we empirically show that on the
ImageNet dataset large minibatches cause optimization dif-
ﬁculties, but when these are addressed the trained networks
exhibit good generalization. Speciﬁcally, we show no loss
of accuracy when training with large minibatch sizes up to
8192 images.
To achieve this result, we adopt a hyper-
parameter-free linear scaling rule for adjusting learning
rates as a function of minibatch size and develop a new
warmup scheme that overcomes optimization challenges
early in training. With these simple techniques, our Caffe2-
based system trains ResNet-50 with a minibatch size of 8192
on 256 GPUs in one hour, while matching small minibatch
accuracy. Using commodity hardware, our implementation
achieves ∼90% scaling efﬁciency when moving from 8 to
256 GPUs. Our ﬁndings enable training visual recognition
models on internet-scale data with high efﬁciency.
1. Introduction
Scale matters. We are in an unprecedented era in AI
research history in which the increasing data and model
scale is rapidly improving accuracy in computer vision
[22, 41, 34, 35, 36, 16], speech [17, 40], and natural lan-
guage processing [7, 38]. Take the profound impact in com-
puter vision as an example: visual representations learned
by deep convolutional neural networks [23, 22] show excel-
lent performance on previously challenging tasks like Ima-
geNet classiﬁcation [33] and can be transferred to difﬁcult
perception problems such as object detection and segmen-

ImageNet top-1 validation error
Figure 1. ImageNet top-1 validation error vs. minibatch size.
Error range of plus/minus two standard deviations is shown. We
present a simple and general technique for scaling distributed syn-
chronous SGD to minibatches of up to 8k images while maintain-
ing the top-1 error of small minibatch training. For all minibatch
sizes we set the learning rate as a linear function of the minibatch
size and apply a simple warmup phase for the ﬁrst few epochs of
training. All other hyper-parameters are kept ﬁxed. Using this
simple approach, accuracy of our models is invariant to minibatch
size (up to an 8k minibatch size). Our techniques enable a lin-
ear reduction in training time with ∼90% efﬁciency as we scale
to large minibatch sizes, allowing us to train an accurate 8k mini-
batch ResNet-50 model in 1 hour on 256 GPUs.
tation [8, 10, 28]. Moreover, this pattern generalizes: larger
datasets and neural network architectures consistently yield
improved accuracy across all tasks that beneﬁt from pre-
training [22, 41, 34, 35, 36, 16]. But as model and data
scale grow, so does training time; discovering the potential
and limits of large-scale deep learning requires developing
novel techniques to keep training time manageable.
The goal of this report is to demonstrate the feasibility of,
and to communicate a practical guide to, large-scale train-
ing with distributed synchronous stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). As an example, we scale ResNet-50 [16] training,
originally performed with a minibatch size of 256 images
(using 8 Tesla P100 GPUs, training time is 29 hours), to
larger minibatches (see Figure 1). In particular, we show
that with a large minibatch size of 8192, we can train
ResNet-50 in 1 hour using 256 GPUs while maintaining

the same level of accuracy as the 256 minibatch baseline.
While distributed synchronous SGD is now commonplace,
no existing results show that generalization accuracy can be
maintained with minibatches as large as 8192 or that such
high-accuracy models can be trained in such short time.
To tackle this unusually large minibatch size, we employ
a simple and hyper-parameter-free linear scaling rule to ad-
just the learning rate. While this guideline is found in ear-
lier work [21, 4], its empirical limits are not well under-
stood and informally we have found that it is not widely
known to the research community. To successfully apply
this rule, we present a new warmup strategy, i.e., a strategy
of using lower learning rates at the start of training [16], to
overcome early optimization difﬁculties. Importantly, not
only does our approach match the baseline validation error,
but also yields training error curves that closely match the
small minibatch baseline. Details are presented in §2.
Our comprehensive experiments in §5 show that opti-
mization difﬁculty is the main issue with large minibatches,
rather than poor generalization (at least on ImageNet), in
contrast to some recent studies [20]. Additionally, we show
that the linear scaling rule and warmup generalize to more
complex tasks including object detection and instance seg-
mentation [9, 31, 14, 28], which we demonstrate via the
recently developed Mask R-CNN [14]. We note that a ro-
bust and successful guideline for addressing a wide range
of minibatch sizes has not been presented in previous work.
While the strategy we deliver is simple, its successful
application requires correct implementation with respect to
seemingly minor and often not well understood implemen-
tation details within deep learning libraries. Subtleties in the
implementation of SGD can lead to incorrect solutions that
are difﬁcult to discover. To provide more helpful guidance
we describe common pitfalls and the relevant implementa-
tion details that can trigger these traps in §3.
Our strategy applies regardless of framework,
but
achieving efﬁcient linear scaling requires nontrivial com-
munication algorithms.
We use the open-source Caffe21
deep learning framework and Big Basin GPU servers [24],
which operates efﬁciently using standard Ethernet network-
ing (as opposed to specialized network interfaces). We de-
scribe the systems algorithms that enable our approach to
operate near its full potential in §4.
The practical advances described in this report are help-
ful across a range of domains.
In an industrial domain,
our system unleashes the potential of training visual models
from internet-scale data, enabling training with billions of
images per day. Of equal importance, in a research domain,
we have found it to simplify migrating algorithms from a
single-GPU to a multi-GPU implementation without requir-
ing hyper-parameter search, e.g. in our experience migrat-
ing Faster R-CNN [31] and ResNets [16] from 1 to 8 GPUs.

2. Large Minibatch SGD
We start by reviewing the formulation of Stochastic Gra-
dient Descent (SGD), which will be the foundation of our
discussions in the following sections. We consider super-
vised learning by minimizing a loss L(w) of the form:
L(w) =
1
|X|
X
x∈X
l(x, w).
(1)
Here w are the weights of a network, X is a labeled training
set, and l(x, w) is the loss computed from samples x ∈X
and their labels y. Typically l is the sum of a classiﬁcation
loss (e.g., cross-entropy) and a regularization loss on w.
Minibatch Stochastic Gradient Descent [32], usually re-
ferred to as simply as SGD in recent literature even though
it operates on minibatches, performs the following update:
wt+1 = wt −η 1
n
X
x∈B
∇l(x, wt).
(2)
Here B is a minibatch sampled from X and n = |B| is the
minibatch size, η is the learning rate, and t is the iteration
index. Note that in practice we use momentum SGD; we
return to a discussion of momentum in §3.
2.1. Learning Rates for Large Minibatches
Our goal is to use large minibatches in place of small
minibatches while maintaining training and generalization
accuracy. This is of particular interest in distributed learn-
ing, because it can allow us to scale to multiple workers2 us-
ing simple data parallelism without reducing the per-worker
workload and without sacriﬁcing model accuracy.
As we will show in comprehensive experiments, we
found that the following learning rate scaling rule is sur-
prisingly effective for a broad range of minibatch sizes:
Linear Scaling Rule: When the minibatch size is
multiplied by k, multiply the learning rate by k.
All other hyper-parameters (weight decay, etc.) are kept un-
changed. As we will show in §5, the linear scaling rule can
help us to not only match the accuracy between using small
and large minibatches, but equally importantly, to largely
match their training curves, which enables rapid debugging
and comparison of experiments prior to convergence.
Interpretation. We present an informal discussion of the
linear scaling rule and why it may be effective. Consider
a network at iteration t with weights wt, and a sequence
of k minibatches Bj for 0 ≤j < k each of size n. We
compare the effect of executing k SGD iterations with small
minibatches Bj and learning rate η versus a single iteration
with a large minibatch ∪jBj of size kn and learning rate ˆη.
2We use the terms ‘worker’ and ‘GPU’ interchangeably in this work, al-
though other implementations of a ‘worker’ are possible. ‘Server’ denotes
a set of 8 GPUs that does not require communication over a network.

According to (2), after k iterations of SGD with learning
rate η and a minibatch size of n we have:
wt+k = wt −η 1
n
X
j<k
X
x∈Bj
∇l(x, wt+j).
(3)
On the other hand, taking a single step with the large mini-
batch ∪jBj of size kn and learning rate ˆη yields:
ˆwt+1 = wt −ˆη 1
kn
X
j<k
X
x∈Bj
∇l(x, wt).
(4)
As expected, the updates differ, and it is unlikely that
ˆwt+1 = wt+k. However, if we could assume ∇l(x, wt) ≈
∇l(x, wt+j) for j < k, then setting ˆη = kη would yield
ˆwt+1 ≈wt+k, and the updates from small and large mini-
batch SGD would be similar. Although this is a strong as-
sumption, we emphasize that if it were true the two updates
are similar only if we set ˆη = kη.
The above interpretation gives intuition for one case
where we may hope the linear scaling rule to apply. In our
experiments with ˆη = kη (and warmup), small and large
minibatch SGD not only result in models with the same ﬁ-
nal accuracy, but also, the training curves match closely.
Our empirical results suggest that the above approximation
might be valid in large-scale, real-world data.
However, there are at least two cases when the condition
∇l(x, wt) ≈∇l(x, wt+j) will clearly not hold. First, in ini-
tial training when the network is changing rapidly, it does
not hold. We address this by using a warmup phase, dis-
cussed in §2.2. Second, minibatch size cannot be scaled in-
deﬁnitely: while results are stable for a large range of sizes,
beyond a certain point accuracy degrades rapidly. Interest-
ingly, this point is as large as ∼8k in ImageNet experiments.
Discussion. The above linear scaling rule was adopted by
Krizhevsky [21], if not earlier. However, Krizhevsky re-
ported a 1% increase of error when increasing the minibatch
size from 128 to 1024, whereas we show how to maintain
accuracy across a much broader regime of minibatch sizes.
Chen et al. [5] presented a comparison of numerous dis-
tributed SGD variants, and although their work also em-
ployed the linear scaling rule, it did not establish a small
minibatch baseline. Li [25] (§4.6) showed distributed Ima-
geNet training with minibatches up to 5120 without a loss
in accuracy after convergence. However, their work did not
demonstrate a hyper-parameter search-free rule for adjust-
ing the learning rate as a function of minibatch size, which
is a central contribution of our work.
In recent work, Bottou et al. [4] (§4.2) review theoretical
tradeoffs of minibatching and show that with the linear scal-
ing rule, solvers follow the same training curve as a function
of number of examples seen, and suggest the learning rate
should not exceed a maximum rate independent of mini-
batch size (which justiﬁes warmup). Our work empirically
tests these theories with unprecedented minibatch sizes.
2.2. Warmup
As we discussed, for large minibatches (e.g., 8k) the lin-
ear scaling rule breaks down when the network is changing
rapidly, which commonly occurs in early stages of train-
ing. We ﬁnd that this issue can be alleviated by a properly
designed warmup [16], namely, a strategy of using less ag-
gressive learning rates at the start of training.
Constant warmup. The warmup strategy presented in [16]
uses a low constant learning rate for the ﬁrst few epochs of
training. As we will show in §5, we have found constant
warmup particularly helpful for prototyping object detec-
tion and segmentation methods [9, 31, 26, 14] that ﬁne-tune
pre-trained layers together with newly initialized layers.
In our ImageNet experiments with a large minibatch of
size kn, we have tried to train with the low learning rate of
η for the ﬁrst 5 epochs and then return to the target learn-
ing rate of ˆη = kη. However, given a large k, we ﬁnd that
this constant warmup is not sufﬁcient to solve the optimiza-
tion problem, and a transition out of the low learning rate
warmup phase can cause the training error to spike. This
leads us to propose the following gradual warmup.
Gradual warmup. We present an alternative warmup that
gradually ramps up the learning rate from a small to a large
value. This ramp avoids a sudden increase of the learning
rate, allowing healthy convergence at the start of training.
In practice, with a large minibatch of size kn, we start from
a learning rate of η and increment it by a constant amount at
each iteration such that it reaches ˆη = kη after 5 epochs (re-
sults are robust to the exact duration of warmup). After the
warmup, we go back to the original learning rate schedule.
2.3. Batch Normalization with Large Minibatches
Batch Normalization (BN) [19] computes statistics along
the minibatch dimension: this breaks the independence of
each sample’s loss, and changes in minibatch size change
the underlying deﬁnition of the loss function being opti-
mized. In the following we will show that a commonly used
‘shortcut’, which may appear to be a practical consideration
to avoid communication overhead, is actually necessary for
preserving the loss function when changing minibatch size.
We note that (1) and (2) assume the per-sample loss
l(x, w) is independent of all other samples. This is not the
case when BN is performed and activations are computed
across samples. We write lB(x, w) to denote that the loss of
a single sample x depends on the statistics of all samples in
its minibatch B. We denote the loss over a single minibatch
B of size n as L(B, w) = 1
n
P
x∈B lB(x, w). With BN, the
training set can be thought of as containing all distinct sub-
sets of size n drawn from the original training set X, which
we denote as Xn. The training loss L(w) then becomes:
L(w) =
1
|Xn|
X
B∈Xn
L(B, w).
(5)
3

--- Page 4 ---
If we view B as a ‘single sample’ in Xn, then the loss of
each single sample B is computed independently.
Note that the minibatch size n over which the BN statis-
tics are computed is a key component of the loss: if the per-
worker minibatch sample size n is changed, it changes the
underlying loss function L that is optimized. More specif-
ically, the mean/variance statistics computed by BN with
different n exhibit different levels of random variation.
In the case of distributed (and multi-GPU) training, if the
per-worker sample size n is kept ﬁxed and the total mini-
batch size is kn, it can be viewed a minibatch of k samples
with each sample Bj independently selected from Xn, so
the underlying loss function is unchanged and is still de-
ﬁned in Xn. Under this point of view, in the BN setting
after seeing k minibatches Bj, (3) and (4) become:
wt+k = wt −η
X
j<k
∇L(Bj, wt+j),
(6)
ˆwt+1 = wt −ˆη 1
k
X
j<k
∇L(Bj, wt).
(7)
Following similar logic as in §2.1, we set ˆη = kη and we
keep the per-worker sample size n constant when we change
the number of workers k.
In this work, we use n = 32 which has performed well
for a wide range of datasets and networks [19, 16]. If n is
adjusted, it should be viewed as a hyper-parameter of BN,
not of distributed training. We also note that the BN statis-
tics should not be computed across all workers, not only for
the sake of reducing communication, but also for maintain-
ing the same underlying loss function being optimized.
3. Subtleties and Pitfalls of Distributed SGD
In practice a distributed implementation has many sub-
tleties. Many common implementation errors change the
deﬁnitions of hyper-parameters, leading to models that train
but whose error may be higher than expected, and such is-
sues can be difﬁcult to discover. While the remarks below
are straightforward, they are important to consider explic-
itly to faithfully implement the underlying solver.
Weight decay. Weight decay is actually the outcome of the
gradient of an L2-regularization term in the loss function.
More formally, the per-sample loss in (1) can be written as
l(x, w) = λ
2 ∥w∥2 + ε(x, w). Here λ
2 ∥w∥2 is the sample-
independent L2 regularization on the weights and ε(x, w)
is a sample-dependent term such as the cross-entropy loss.
The SGD update in (2) can be written as:
wt+1 = wt −ηλwt −η 1
n
X
x∈B
∇ε(x, wt).
(8)
In practice,
usually only the sample-dependent term
P ∇ε(x, wt) is computed by backprop; the term λwt is
computed separately and added to the aggregated gradients
contributed by ε(x, wt). If there is no weight decay term,
there are many equivalent ways of scaling the learning rate,
including scaling the term ε(x, wt). However, as can be
seen from (8), in general this is not the case. We summarize
these observations in the following remark:
Remark 1: Scaling the cross-entropy loss is
not equivalent to scaling the learning rate.
Momentum correction. Momentum SGD is a commonly
adopted modiﬁcation to the vanilla SGD in (2). A reference
implementation of momentum SGD has the following form:
ut+1 = mut + 1
n
X
x∈B
∇l(x, wt)
wt+1 = wt −ηut+1.
(9)
Here m is the momentum decay factor and u is the update
tensor. A popular variant absorbs the learning rate η into
the update tensor. Substituting vt for ηut in (9) yields:
vt+1 = mvt + η 1
n
X
x∈B
∇l(x, wt)
wt+1 = wt −vt+1.
(10)
For a ﬁxed η, the two are equivalent. However, we note that
while u only depends on the gradients and is independent
of η, v is entangled with η. When η changes, to maintain
equivalence with the reference variant in (9), the update for
v should be: vt+1 = m ηt+1
ηt vt + ηt+1 1
n
P ∇l(x, wt). We
refer to the factor ηt+1
ηt
as the momentum correction. We
found that this is especially important for stabilizing train-
ing when ηt+1 ≫ηt, otherwise the history term vt is too
small which leads to instability (for ηt+1 < ηt momentum
correction is less critical). This leads to our second remark:
Remark 2: Apply momentum correction
after changing learning rate if using (10).
Gradient aggregation. For k workers each with a per-
worker minibatch of size n, following (4), gradient aggre-
gation must be performed over the entire set of kn examples
according to
1
kn
P
j
P
x∈Bj l(x, wt). Loss layers are typi-
cally implemented to compute an average loss over their lo-
cal input, which amounts to computing a per-worker loss of
P l(x, wt)/n. Given this, correct aggregation requires av-
eraging the k gradients in order to recover the missing 1/k
factor. However, standard communication primitives like
allreduce [11] perform summing, not averaging. Therefore,
it is more efﬁcient to absorb the 1/k scaling into the loss,
in which case only the loss’s gradient with respect to its in-
put needs to be scaled, removing the need to scale the entire
gradient vector. We summarize this as follows:
Remark 3: Normalize the per-worker loss by
total minibatch size kn, not per-worker size n.
We also note that it may be incorrect to ‘cancel k’ by setting
ˆη = η (not kη) and normalizing the loss by 1/n (not 1/kn),
which can lead to incorrect weight decay (see Remark 1).

Data shufﬂing. SGD is typically analyzed as a process that
samples data randomly with replacement. In practice, com-
mon SGD implementations apply random shufﬂing of the
training set during each SGD epoch, which can give better
results [3, 13]. To provide fair comparisons with baselines
that use shufﬂing (e.g., [16]), we ensure the samples in one
epoch done by k workers are from a single consistent ran-
dom shufﬂing of the training set. To achieve this, for each
epoch we use a random shufﬂing that is partitioned into k
parts, each of which is processed by one of the k workers.
Failing to correctly implement random shufﬂing in multiple
workers may lead to noticeably different behavior, which
may contaminate results and conclusions. In summary:
Remark 4: Use a single random shufﬂing of the training
data (per epoch) that is divided amongst all k workers.
4. Communication
In order to scale beyond the 8 GPUs in a single Big Basin
server [24], gradient aggregation has to span across servers
on a network. To allow for near perfect linear scaling, the
aggregation must be performed in parallel with backprop.
This is possible because there is no data dependency be-
tween gradients across layers. Therefore, as soon as the gra-
dient for a layer is computed, it is aggregated across work-
ers, while gradient computation for the next layer continues
(as discussed in [5]). We give full details next.
4.1. Gradient Aggregation
For every gradient, aggregation is done using an allre-
duce operation (similar to the MPI collective operation
MPI Allreduce [11]). Before allreduce starts every GPU has
its locally computed gradients and after allreduce completes
every GPU has the sum of all k gradients. As the number
of parameters grows and compute performance of GPUs in-
creases, it becomes harder to hide the cost of aggregation in
the backprop phase. Training techniques to overcome these
effects are beyond the scope of this work (e.g., quantized
gradients [18], Block-Momentum SGD [6]). However, at
the scale of this work, collective communication was not
a bottleneck, as we were able to achieve near-linear SGD
scaling by using an optimized allreduce implementation.
Our implementation of allreduce consists of three phases
for communication within and across servers: (1) buffers
from the 8 GPUs within a server are summed into a sin-
gle buffer for each server, (2) the results buffers are shared
and summed across all servers, and ﬁnally (3) the results
are broadcast onto each GPU. For the local reduction and
broadcast in phases (1) and (3) we used NVIDIA Collective
Communication Library (NCCL)3 for buffers of size 256
KB or more and a simple implementation consisting of a
3https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl
number of GPU-to-host memory copies and a CPU reduc-
tion otherwise. NCCL uses GPU kernels to accelerate in-
traserver collectives, so this approach dedicates more time
on the GPU to backprop while using the CPU resources that
would otherwise have been idle to improve throughput.
For interserver allreduce, we implemented two of the
best algorithms for bandwidth-limited scenarios: the re-
cursive halving and doubling algorithm [30, 37] and the
bucket algorithm (also known as the ring algorithm) [2].
For both, each server sends and receives 2 p−1
p b bytes of
data, where b is the buffer size in bytes and p is the num-
ber of servers. While the halving/doubling algorithm con-
sists of 2 log2(p) communication steps, the ring algorithm
consists of 2(p −1) steps. This generally makes the halv-
ing/doubling algorithm faster in latency-limited scenarios
(i.e., for small buffer sizes and/or large server counts). In
practice, we found the halving/doubling algorithm to per-
form much better than the ring algorithm for buffer sizes
up to a million elements (and even higher on large server
counts). On 32 servers (256 GPUs), using halving/doubling
led to a speedup of 3× over the ring algorithm.
The halving/doubling algorithm consists of a reduce-
scatter collective followed by an allgather. In the ﬁrst step
of reduce-scatter, servers communicate in pairs (rank 0 with
1, 2 with 3, etc.), sending and receiving for different halves
of their input buffers. For example, rank 0 sends the second
half of its buffer to 1 and receives the ﬁrst half of the buffer
from 1. A reduction over the received data is performed be-
fore proceeding to the next step, where the distance to the
destination rank is doubled while the data sent and received
is halved. After the reduce-scatter phase is ﬁnished, each
server has a portion of the ﬁnal reduced vector.
This is followed by the allgather phase, which retraces
the communication pattern from the reduce-scatter in re-
verse, this time simply concatenating portions of the ﬁnal
reduced vector. At each server, the portion of the buffer that
was being sent in the reduce-scatter is received in the all-
gather, and the portion that was being received is now sent.
To support non-power-of-two number of servers, we
used the binary blocks algorithm [30]. This is a generalized
version of the halving/doubling algorithm where servers
are partitioned into power-of-two blocks and two additional
communication steps are used, one immediately after the
intrablock reduce-scatter and one before the intrablock all-
gather. Non-power-of-two cases have some degree of load
imbalance compared to power-of-two, though in our runs
we did not see signiﬁcant performance degradation.
4.2. Software
The allreduce algorithms described are implemented in
Gloo4, a library for collective communication. It supports
4https://github.com/facebookincubator/gloo
5

--- Page 6 ---
multiple communication contexts, which means no addi-
tional synchronization is needed to execute multiple allre-
duce instances in parallel. Local reduction and broadcast
(described as phases (1) and (3)) are pipelined with inter-
server allreduce where possible.
Caffe2 supports multi-threaded execution of the compute
graph that represents a training iteration. Whenever there is
no data dependency between subgraphs, multiple threads
can execute those subgraphs in parallel. Applying this to
backprop, local gradients can be computed in sequence,
without dealing with allreduce or weight updates.
This
means that during backprop, the set of runnable subgraphs
may grow faster than we can execute them. For subgraphs
that contain an allreduce run, all servers must choose to exe-
cute the same subgraph from the set of runnable subgraphs.
Otherwise, we risk distributed deadlock where servers are
attempting to execute non-intersecting sets of subgraphs.
With allreduce being a collective operation, servers would
time out waiting. To ensure correct execution we impose a
partial order on these subgraphs. This is implemented using
a cyclical control input, where completion of the n-th allre-
duce unblocks execution of the (n + c)-th allreduce, with
c being the maximum number of concurrent allreduce runs.
Note that this number should be chosen to be lower than the
number of threads used to execute the full compute graph.
4.3. Hardware
We used Facebook’s Big Basin [24] GPU servers for
our experiments.
Each server contains 8 NVIDIA Tesla
P100 GPUs that are interconnected with NVIDIA NVLink.
For local storage, each server has 3.2TB of NVMe SSDs.
For network connectivity, the servers have a Mellanox
ConnectX-4 50Gbit Ethernet network card and are con-
nected to Wedge100 [1] Ethernet switches.
We have found 50Gbit of network bandwidth sufﬁcient
for distributed synchronous SGD for ResNet-50, per the
following analysis. ResNet-50 has approximately 25 mil-
lion parameters. This means the total size of parameters is
25 · 106 · sizeof(ﬂoat) = 100MB. Backprop for ResNet-50
on a single NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU takes 120 ms. Given
that allreduce requires ∼2× bytes on the network compared
to the value it operates on, this leads to a peak bandwidth re-
quirement of 200MB/0.125s = 1600MB/s, or 12.8 Gbit/s,
not taking into account communication overhead. When we
add a smudge factor for network overhead, we reach a peak
bandwidth requirement for ResNet-50 of ∼15 Gbit/s.
As this peak bandwidth requirement only holds during
backprop, the network is free to be used for different tasks
that are less latency sensitive then aggregation (e.g. reading
data or saving network snapshots) during the forward pass.
5. Main Results and Analysis
Our main result is that we can train ResNet-50 [16] on
ImageNet [33] using 256 workers in one hour, while match-
ing the accuracy of small minibatch training. Applying the
linear scaling rule along with a warmup strategy allows us to
seamlessly scale between small and large minibatches (up
to 8k images) without tuning additional hyper-parameters
or impacting accuracy. In the following subsections we:
(1) describe experimental settings, (2) establish the effec-
tiveness of large minibatch training, (3) perform a deeper
experimental analysis, (4) show our ﬁndings generalize to
object detection/segmentation, and (5) provide timings.
5.1. Experimental Settings
The 1000-way ImageNet classiﬁcation task [33] serves
as our main experimental benchmark. Models are trained
on the ∼1.28 million training images and evaluated by top-
1 error on the 50,000 validation images.
We use the ResNet-50 [16] variant from [12], noting that
the stride-2 convolutions are on 3×3 layers instead of on
1×1 layers as in [16]. We use Nesterov momentum [29]
with m of 0.9 following [12] but note that standard mo-
mentum as was used in [16] is equally effective. We use a
weight decay λ of 0.0001 and following [16] we do not ap-
ply weight decay on the learnable BN coefﬁcients (namely,
γ and β in [19]). In order to keep the training objective
ﬁxed, which depends on the BN batch size n as described
in §2.3, we use n = 32 throughout, regardless of the overall
minibatch size. As in [12], we compute the BN statistics
using running average (with momentum 0.9).
All models are trained for 90 epochs regardless of mini-
batch sizes. We apply the linear scaling rule from §2.1 and
use a learning rate of η = 0.1 · kn
256 that is linear in the mini-
batch size kn. With k = 8 workers (GPUs) and n = 32
samples per worker, η = 0.1 as in [16]. We call this num-
ber (0.1 · kn
256) the reference learning rate, and reduce it by
1/10 at the 30-th, 60-th, and 80-th epoch, similar to [16].
We adopt the initialization of [15] for all convolutional
layers. The 1000-way fully-connected layer is initialized by
drawing weights from a zero-mean Gaussian with standard
deviation of 0.01. We have found that although SGD with a
small minibatch is not sensitive to initialization due to BN,
this is not the case for a substantially large minibatch. Addi-
tionally we require an appropriate warmup strategy to avoid
optimization difﬁculties in early training.
For BN layers, the learnable scaling coefﬁcient γ is ini-
tialized to be 1, except for each residual block’s last BN
where γ is initialized to be 0. Setting γ = 0 in the last BN of
each residual block causes the forward/backward signal ini-
tially to propagate through the identity shortcut of ResNets,
which we found to ease optimization at the start of training.
This initialization improves all models but is particularly
helpful for large minibatch training as we will show.

--- Page 7 ---
We use scale and aspect ratio data augmentation [36] as
in [12]. The network input image is a 224×224 pixel ran-
dom crop from an augmented image or its horizontal ﬂip.
The input image is normalized by the per-color mean and
standard deviation, as in [12].
Handling random variation. As models are subject to
random variation in training, we compute a model’s error
rate as the median error of the ﬁnal 5 epochs. Moreover,
we report the mean and standard deviation (std) of the error
from 5 independent runs. This gives us more conﬁdence in
our results and also provides a measure of model stability.
The random variation of ImageNet models has generally
not been reported in previous work (largely due to resource
limitations). We emphasize that ignoring random variation
may cause unreliable conclusions, especially if results are
from a single trial, or the best of many.
Baseline. Under these settings, we establish a ResNet-50
baseline using k = 8 (8 GPUs in one server) and n = 32
images per worker (minibatch size of kn = 256), as in [16].
Our baseline has a top-1 validation error of 23.60% ±0.12.
As a reference, ResNet-50 from fb.resnet.torch [12]
has 24.01% error, and that of the original ResNet paper [16]
has 24.7% under weaker data augmentation.
5.2. Optimization or Generalization Issues?
We establish our main results on large minibatch train-
ing by exploring optimization and generalization behaviors.
We will demonstrate that with a proper warmup strategy,
large minibatch SGD can both match the training curves of
small minibatch SGD and also match the validation error.
In other words, in our experiments both optimization and
generalization of large minibatch training matches that of
small minibatch training. Moreover, in §5.4 we will show
that these models exhibit good generalization behavior to
the object detection/segmentation transfer tasks, matching
the transfer quality of small minibatch models.
For the following results, we use k = 256 and n = 32,
which results in a minibatch size kn = 8k (we use ‘1k’
to denote 1024). As discussed, our baseline has a mini-
batch size of kn = 256 and a reference learning rate of
η = 0.1. Applying the linear scaling rule gives η = 3.2
as the reference learning rate for our large minibatch runs.
We test three warmup strategies as discussed in §2.2: no
warmup, constant warmup with η = 0.1 for 5 epochs,
and gradual warmup which starts with η = 0.1 and is
linearly increased to η = 3.2 over 5 epochs. All models
are trained from scratch and all other hyper-parameters are
kept ﬁxed. We emphasize that while better results for any
particular minibatch size could be obtained by optimizing
hyper-parameters for that case; our goal is to match er-
rors across minibatch sizes by using a general strategy that
avoids hyper-parameter tuning for each minibatch size.

Table 1. Validation error on ImageNet using ResNet-50 (mean
and std computed over 5 trials). We compare the small minibatch
model (kn=256) with large minibatch models (kn=8k) with vari-
ous warmup strategies. Observe that the top-1 validation error for
small and large minibatch training (with gradual warmup) is quite
close: 23.60% ±0.12 vs. 23.74% ±0.09, respectively.
Training error. Training curves are shown in Figure 2.
With no warmup (2a), the training curve for large minibatch
of kn = 8k is inferior to training with a small minibatch of
kn = 256 across all epochs. A constant warmup strategy
(2b) actually degrades results: although the small constant
learning rate can decrease error during warmup, the error
spikes immediately after and training never fully recovers.
Our main result is that with gradual warmup, large mini-
batch training error matches the baseline training curve ob-
tained with small minibatches, see Figure 2c.
Although
the large minibatch curve starts higher due to the low η
in the warmup phase, it catches up shortly thereafter. Af-
ter about 20 epochs, the small and large minibatch training
curves match closely. The comparison between no warmup
and gradual warmup suggests that large minibatch sizes are
challenged by optimization difﬁculties in early training and
if these difﬁculties are addressed, the training error and its
curve can match a small minibatch baseline closely.
Validation error. Table 1 shows the validation error for
the three warmup strategies. The no-warmup variant has
∼1.2% higher validation error than the baseline which is
likely caused by the ∼2.1% increase in training error (Fig-
ure 2a), rather than overﬁtting or other causes for poor gen-
eralization. This argument is further supported by our grad-
ual warmup experiment. The gradual warmup variant has
a validation error within 0.14% of the baseline (noting that
std of these estimates is ∼0.1%). Given that the ﬁnal train-
ing errors (Figure 2c) match nicely in this case, it shows that
if the optimization issues are addressed, there is no apparent
generalization degradation observed using large minibatch
training, even if the minibatch size goes from 256 to 8k.
Finally, Figure 4 shows both the training and valida-
tion curves for the large minibatch training with gradual
warmup. As can be seen, validation error starts to match
the baseline closely after the second learning rate drop; ac-
tually, the validation curves can match earlier if BN statis-
tics are recomputed prior to evaluating the error instead of
using the running average (see also caption in Figure 4).

Figure 4. Training and validation curves for large minibatch
SGD with gradual warmup vs. small minibatch SGD. Both sets
of curves match closely after training for sufﬁcient epochs. We
note that the BN statistics (for inference only) are computed us-
ing running average, which is updated less frequently with a large
minibatch and thus is noisier in early training (this explains the
larger variation of the validation error in early epochs).
5.3. Analysis Experiments
Minibatch size vs. error. Figure 1 (page 1) shows top-
1 validation error for models trained with minibatch sizes
ranging from of 64 to 65536 (64k). For all models we used
the linear scaling rule and set the reference learning rate
as η = 0.1 ·
kn
256. For models with kn > 256, we used
the gradual warmup strategy always starting with η = 0.1
and increasing linearly to the reference learning rate after
5 epochs. Figure 1 illustrates that validation error remains
stable across a broad range of minibatch sizes, from 64 to
8k, after which it begins to increase. Beyond 64k training
diverges when using the linear learning rate scaling rule.5
Training curves for various minibatch sizes. Each of the
nine plots in Figure 3 shows the top-1 training error curve
for the 256 minibatch baseline (orange) and a second curve
corresponding to different size minibatch (blue). Valida-
tion errors are shown in the plot legends. As minibatch size
increases, all training curves show some divergence from
the baseline at the start of training. However, in the cases
where the ﬁnal validation error closely matches the base-
line (kn ≤8k), the training curves also closely match after
the initial epochs. When the validation errors do not match
(kn ≥16k), there is a noticeable gap in the training curves
for all epochs. This suggests that when comparing a new
setting, the training curves can be used as a reliable proxy
for success well before training ﬁnishes.
Alternative learning rate rules. Table 2a shows results for
multiple learning rates. For small minibatches (kn = 256),
5We note that because of the availability of hardware, we simulated dis-
tributed training of very large minibatches (≥12k) on a single server by us-
ing multiple gradient accumulation steps between SGD updates. We have
thoroughly veriﬁed that gradient accumulation on a single server yields
equivalent results relative to distributed training.

Figure 5. Training curves for small minibatches with different
learning rates η. As expected, changing η results in curves that do
not match. This is in contrast to changing batch-size (and linearly
scaling η), which results in curves that do match, e.g. see Figure 3.
η = 0.1 gives best error but slightly smaller or larger η also
work well. When applying the linear scaling rule with a
minibatch of 8k images, the optimum error is also achieved
with η = 0.1 · 32, showing the successful application of the
linear scaling rule. However, in this case results are more
sensitive to changing η. In practice we suggest to use a
minibatch size that is not close to the breaking point.
Figure 5 shows the training curves of a 256 minibatch
using η = 0.1 or 0.2. It shows that changing the learning
rate η in general changes the overall shapes of the train-
ing curves, even if the ﬁnal error is similar. Contrasting
this result with the success of the linear scaling rule (that
can match both the ﬁnal error and the training curves when
minibatch sizes change) may reveal some underlying invari-
ance maintained between small and large minibatches.
We also show two alternative strategies: keeping η ﬁxed
at 0.1 or using 0.1·
√
32 according to the square root scaling
rule that was justiﬁed theoretically in [21] on grounds that it
scales η by the inverse amount of the reduction in the gradi-
ent estimator’s standard deviation. For fair comparisons we
also use gradual warmup for 0.1 ·
√
32. Both policies work
poorly in practice as the results show.
Batch Normalization γ initialization. Table 2b controls
for the impact of the new BN γ initialization introduced in
§5.1. We show results for minibatch sizes 256 and 8k with
the standard BN initialization (γ = 1 for all BN layers)
and with our initialization (γ = 0 for the ﬁnal BN layer
of each residual block). The results show improved per-
formance with γ = 0 for both minibatch sizes, and the
improvement is slightly larger for the 8k minibatch size.
This behavior also suggests that large minibatches are more
easily affected by optimization difﬁculties. We expect that
improved optimization and initialization methods will help
push the boundary of large minibatch training.

(a) Comparison of learning rate scaling rules. A reference learning rate
of η = 0.1 works best for kn = 256 (23.68% error). The linear scal-

performance (23.74% error). Other ways of scaling η give worse results.

and a linearly scaled η = 3.2 results in an error of 22.36%
vs. the kn = 256 baseline which achieves 22.08% with
η = 0.1. In other words, ResNet-101 trained with mini-
batch 8k has a small 0.28% increase in error vs. the baseline.
It is likely that the minibatch size of 8k lies on the edge of
the useful minibatch training regime for ResNet-101, simi-
larly to ResNet-50 (see Figure 1).
The training time of ResNet-101 is 92.5 minutes in our
implementation using 256 Tesla P100 GPUs and a mini-
batch size of 8k. We believe this is a compelling result if
the speed-accuracy tradeoff of ResNet-101 is preferred.
ImageNet-5k. Observing the sharp increase in validation
error between minibatch sizes of 8k and 16k on ImageNet-
1k (Figure 1), a natural question is if the position of this
‘elbow’ in the error curve is a function of dataset infor-
mation content.
To investigate this question, we adopt
the ImageNet-5k dataset suggested by Xie et al. [39] that
extends ImageNet-1k to 6.8 million images (roughly 5×
larger) by adding 4k additional categories from ImageNet-
22k [33]. We evaluate the 1k-way classiﬁcation error on the
original ImageNet-1k validation set as in [39].

(a) Transfer learning of large minibatch pre-training to Mask R-CNN.
Box and mask AP (on COCO minival) are nearly identical for ResNet-
50 models pre-trained with minibatches from 256 to 8k examples. With
a minibatch pre-training size of 16k both ImageNet validation error and
COCO AP deteriorate. This indicates that as long as ImageNet error is
matched, large minibatches do not degrade transfer learning performance.

is very similar to the ImageNet-1k curve, showing that for
practitioners it is unlikely that even a 5× increase in dataset
size will automatically lead to a meaningful increase in use-
able minibatch size. Quantitatively, using an 8k minibatch
increases the validation error by 0.26% from 25.83% for a
256 minibatch to 26.09%. An understanding of the precise
relationship between generalization error, minibatch size,
and dataset information content is open for future work.
5.4. Generalization to Detection and Segmentation
A low error rate on ImageNet is not typically an end
goal. Instead, the utility of ImageNet training lies in learn-

ing good features that transfer, or generalize well, to re-
lated tasks. A question of key importance is if the features
learned with large minibatches generalize as well as the fea-
tures learned with small minibatches?
To test this, we adopt the object detection and in-
stance segmentation tasks on COCO [27] as these advanced
perception tasks beneﬁt substantially from ImageNet pre-
training [10]. We use the recently developed Mask R-CNN
[14] system that is capable of learning to detect and segment
object instances. We follow all of the hyper-parameter set-
tings used in [14] and only change the ResNet-50 model
used to initialize Mask R-CNN training. We train Mask R-
CNN on the COCO trainval35k split and report results
on the 5k image minival split used in [14].
It is interesting to note that the concept of minibatch
size in Mask R-CNN is different from the classiﬁcation
setting. As an extension of the image-centric Fast/Faster
R-CNN [9, 31], Mask R-CNN exhibits different minibatch
sizes for different layers: the network backbone uses two
images (per GPU), but each image contributes 512 Regions-
of-Interest for computing classiﬁcation (multinomial cross-
entropy), bounding-box regression (smooth-L1/Huber), and
pixel-wise mask (28 × 28 binomial cross-entropy) losses.
This diverse set of minibatch sizes and loss functions pro-
vides a good test case to the robustness of our approach.
Transfer learning from large minibatch pre-training.
To test how large minibatch pre-training effects Mask R-
CNN, we take ResNet-50 models trained on ImageNet-1k
with 256 to 16k minibatches and use them to initialize Mask
R-CNN training. For each minibatch size we pre-train 5
models and then train Mask R-CNN using all 5 models on
COCO (35 models total). We report the mean box and mask
APs, averaged over the 5 trials, in Table 3a. The results
show that as long as ImageNet validation error is kept low,
which is true up to 8k batch size, generalization to object de-

Figure 8. Distributed synchronous SGD throughput. The small
overhead when moving from a single server with 8 GPUs to multi-
server distributed training (Figure 7, blue curve) results in linear
throughput scaling that is marginally below ideal scaling (∼90%
efﬁciency).
Most of the allreduce communication time is hid-
den by pipelining allreduce operations with gradient computation.
Moreover, this is achieved with commodity Ethernet hardware.
tection matches the AP of the small minibatch baseline. We
emphasize that we observed no generalization issues when
transferring across datasets (from ImageNet to COCO) and
across tasks (from classiﬁcation to detection/segmentation)
using models trained with large minibatches.
Linear scaling rule applied to Mask R-CNN. We also
show evidence of the generality of the linear scaling rule us-
ing Mask R-CNN. In fact, this rule was already used with-
out explicit discussion in [16] and was applied effectively
as the default Mask R-CNN training scheme when using 8
GPUs. Table 3b provides experimental results showing that
when training with 1, 2, 4, or 8 GPUs the linear learning rate
rule results in constant box and mask AP. For these experi-
ments, we initialize Mask R-CNN from the released MSRA
ResNet-50 model, as was done in [14].
5.5. Run Time
Figure 7 shows two visualizations of the run time char-
acteristics of our system. The blue curve is the time per
iteration as minibatch size varies from 256 to 11264 (11k).
Notably this curve is relatively ﬂat and the time per itera-
tion increases only 12% while scaling the minibatch size by
44×. Visualized another way, the orange curve shows the
approximately linear decrease in time per epoch from over
16 minutes to just 30 seconds. Run time performance can
also be viewed in terms of throughput (images / second), as
shown in Figure 8. Relative to a perfectly efﬁcient extrapo-
lation of the 8 GPU baseline, our implementation achieves
∼90% scaling efﬁciency.
