ArcFace: Additive Angular Margin Loss for Deep
Face Recognition
Jiankang Deng, Jia Guo, Jing Yang, Niannan Xue, Irene Kotsia, and Stefanos Zafeiriou
Abstract—Recently, a popular line of research in face recognition is adopting margins in the well-established softmax loss function to
maximize class separability. In this paper, we ﬁrst introduce an Additive Angular Margin Loss (ArcFace), which not only has a clear
geometric interpretation but also signiﬁcantly enhances the discriminative power. Since ArcFace is susceptible to the massive label
noise, we further propose sub-center ArcFace, in which each class contains K sub-centers and training samples only need to be
close to any of the K positive sub-centers. Sub-center ArcFace encourages one dominant sub-class that contains the majority of clean
faces and non-dominant sub-classes that include hard or noisy faces. Based on this self-propelled isolation, we boost the performance
through automatically purifying raw web faces under massive real-world noise. Besides discriminative feature embedding, we also
explore the inverse problem, mapping feature vectors to face images. Without training any additional generator or discriminator, the
pre-trained ArcFace model can generate identity-preserved face images for both subjects inside and outside the training data only by
using the network gradient and Batch Normalization (BN) priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ArcFace can enhance the
discriminative feature embedding as well as strengthen the generative face synthesis.

INTRODUCTION
F
ACE representation using DCNN embedding is the method of
choice for face recognition [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. DCNNs
map the face image, typically after a pose normalization step [7],
[8], into a feature that should have small intra-class and large
inter-class distance. There are two main lines of research to train
DCNNs for face recognition. Some train a multi-class classiﬁer
which can separate different identities in the training set, such
by using a softmax classiﬁer [2], [4], [9], [10], [11], and the
others learn directly an embedding, such as the triplet loss [3].
Based on the large-scale training data and the elaborate DCNN
architectures, both the softmax-loss-based methods [9] and the
triplet-loss-based methods [3] can obtain excellent performance
on face recognition. However, both the softmax loss and the triplet
loss have some drawbacks. For the softmax loss: (1) the learned
features are separable for the closed-set classiﬁcation problem but
not discriminative enough for the open-set face recognition prob-
lem; (2) the size of the linear transformation matrix W ∈Rd×N
increases linearly with the identities number N. For the triplet
loss: (1) there is a combinatorial explosion in the number of face
triplets especially for large-scale datasets, leading to a signiﬁcant
increase in the number of iteration steps; (2) semi-hard sample
mining is a quite difﬁcult problem for effective model training.
To adopt margin beneﬁt but avoid the sampling problem in
the Triplet loss [3], recent methods [13], [14], [15] focus on
incorporating margin penalty into a more feasible framework,
the softmax loss, which has global sample-to-class comparisons

within the multiplication step between the embedding feature and
the linear transformation matrix. Naturally, each column of the
linear transformation matrix is viewed as a class center represent-
ing a certain class. Sphereface [13] introduces the important idea
of angular margin, however their loss function requires a series
of approximations, which results in an unstable training of the
network. In order to stabilize training, they propose a hybrid loss
function which includes the standard softmax loss. Empirically,
the softmax loss dominates the training process, because the
integer-based multiplicative angular margin makes the target logit
curve very precipitous and thus hinders convergence.
In this paper, we propose an Additive Angular Margin
loss
[16] to stabilize the training process and further improve
the discriminative power of the face recognition model. More
speciﬁcally, the dot product between the DCNN feature and
the last fully connected layer is equal to the cosine distance
after feature and center normalization. We utilize the arc-cosine
function to calculate the angle between the current feature and the
target center. Afterwards, we introduce an additive angular margin
to the target angle, and we get the target logit back again by the
cosine function. Then, we re-scale all logits by a ﬁxed feature
norm, and the subsequent steps are exactly the same as in the
softmax loss. Due to the exact correspondence between the angle
and arc in the normalized hypersphere, our method can directly
optimize the geodesic distance margin, thus we call it ArcFace.
Even though impressive performance has been achieved by
the margin-based softmax methods [17], [13], [14], [15], they
all need to be trained on well-annotated clean datasets [18],
which require intensive human efforts. Wang et al. [18] found
that faces with label noise signiﬁcantly degenerate the recognition
accuracy and manually built a high-quality dataset including 1.7M
images of 59K celebrities. However, it took 50 annotators to work
continuously for one month to clean the dataset, which further
demonstrates the difﬁculty of obtaining a large-scale clean dataset
for face recognition. Since accurate manual annotations can be

comparisons with angular margins.
expensive [18], learning with massive noisy data has recently
attracted much attention [19], [20], [21]. However, computing
time-varying weights for samples [19] or designing piece-wise
loss functions [20] according to the current model’s predictions
can only alleviate the inﬂuence from noisy data to some extent as
the robustness and improvement depend on the initial performance
of the model. Besides, the co-mining method [21] requires to train
twin networks together thus it is less practical for training large
models on large-scale datasets.
To improve the robustness under massive real-world noise,
we relax the intra-class constraint of forcing all samples close to
the corresponding positive centers by introducing sub-classes into
ArcFace [22]. As illustrated in Figure 1, we design K sub-centers
for each class and the training sample only needs to be close to
any of the K positive sub-centers instead of the only one positive
center. If a training face is a noisy sample, it does not belong to
the corresponding positive class. In ArcFace, this noisy sample
generates a large wrong loss value, which impairs the model
training. In sub-center ArcFace, the intra-class constraint enforces
the training sample to be close to one of the multiple positive
sub-centers but not all of them. The noise is likely to form a non-
dominant sub-class and will not be enforced into the dominant
sub-class. Therefore, sub-center ArcFace is more robust to noise.
In our experiments, we ﬁnd the proposed sub-center ArcFace can
encourage one dominant sub-class that contains the majority clean
faces and multiple non-dominant sub-classes that include hard or
noisy faces. This automatic isolation can be directly employed
to clean the training data through dropping non-dominant sub-
centers and high-conﬁdent noisy samples. Based on the proposed
sub-center ArcFace, we can automatically obtain large-scale clean
training data from raw web face images to further improve the
discriminative power of the face recognition model.
In Figure 1, we compare the differences between Triplet [3],
Tuplet [12], ArcFace and sub-center ArcFace. Triplet loss [3] only
considers local sample-to-sample comparisons with Euclidean
margins within the mini-batch. Tuplet loss [12] further enhances
the comparisons by using all of the negative pairs within the
mini-batch. By contrast, the proposed ArcFace and sub-center
ArcFace conduct global sample-to-class and sample-to-subclass
comparisons with angular margins.
As the proposed ArcFace is effective for the mapping from
the face image to the discriminative feature embedding, we are
also interested in the inverse problem: the mapping from a low-
dimensional latent space to a highly nonlinear face space. Syn-
thesizing face images [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29] has
recently brought much attention from the community. DeepDream
[30] is proposed to transform a random input to yield a high output
activation for a chosen class by employing the gradient from the
pre-trained classiﬁcation model and some regularizers (e.g. total
variance [31] for maintaining piece-wise constant patches). Even
though DeepDream can keep the selected output response high
to preserve identity, the resulting faces are not realistic, lacking
natural face statistics. Inspired by the pioneer generative face
recognition model (Eigenface [32]) and recent data-free methods
[33], [34], [35] for restoring ImageNet images, we employ the
statistic prior (e.g. mean and variance stored in the BN layers)
to constrain the face generation. In this paper, we show that the
proposed ArcFace can also enhance the generative power. Without
training any additional generator or discriminator like in Genera-
tive Adversarial Networks (GANs) [36], the pre-trained ArcFace
model can generate identity-preserved and visually reasonable
face images only by using the gradient and BN priors.
The advantages of the proposed methods can be summarized
as follows:
Intuitive. ArcFace directly optimizes the geodesic distance margin
by virtue of the exact correspondence between the angle and arc
in the normalized hypersphere. The proposed additive angular
margin loss can intuitively enhance the intra-class compactness
and inter-class discrepancy during discriminative learning of face
feature embedding.
Economical. We introduce sub-class into ArcFace to improve its
robustness under massive real-world noises. The proposed sub-
center ArcFace can automatically clean the large-scale raw web
faces (e.g. MS1MV0 [37] and Celeb500K [38]) without expensive
and intensive human efforts. The automatically cleaned training
data, named IBUG-500K, has been released to facilitate future
research.
Easy. ArcFace only needs several lines of code and is extremely
easy to implement in the computational-graph-based deep learning
frameworks, e.g. MxNet [39], Pytorch [40] and Tensorﬂow [41].
Furthermore, contrary to the works in [13], [42], ArcFace does
not need to be combined with other loss functions in order to have
stable convergence.
Efﬁcient. ArcFace only adds negligible computational complexity
during training. The proposed center parallel strategy can easily
support millions of identities for training on a single server (8
GPUs).
Effective. Using IBUG-500K as the training data, ArcFace

achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten face recognition
benchmarks including large-scale image and video datasets
collected by us. Impressively, our model reaches 97.27%
TPR@FPR=1e-4 on IJB-C. Code and pre-trained models have
been made available.
Engaging. ArcFace can not only enhance the discriminative power
but also strengthen the generative power. By accessing the network
gradient and employing the statistic priors stored in the BN layers,
the pre-trained ArcFace model can restore identity-preserved and
visually plausible face images for both subjects inside and outside
the training data.

RELATED WORK
Face Recognition with Margin Penalty. As shown in Figure
1, the pioneering work [3] uses the Triplet loss to exploit triplet
data such that faces from the same class are closer than faces
from different classes by a clear Euclidean distance margin. Even
though the Triplet loss makes perfect sense for face recognition,
the sample-to-sample comparisons are local within mini-batch and
the training procedure for the Triplet loss is very challenging
as there is a combinatorial explosion in the number of triplets
especially for large-scale datasets, requiring effective sampling
strategies to select informative mini-batch [43], [3] and choose
representative triplets within the mini-batch [44], [12]. As the
Triplet loss trained with semi-hard negative mining converges
slower due to the ignorance of too many examples, a double-
margin contrastive loss is proposed in [45] to explore more
informative and stable examples by distance weighted sampling,
thus it converges faster and more accurately. Some other works
tried to reduce the total number of triplets with proxies [46],
[47], i.e., sample-to-sample comparison is changed into sample-
to-proxy comparison. However, sampling and proxy methods only
optimize the embedding of partial classes instead of all classes in
one iteration step.
Margin-based softmax methods [13], [17], [14], [15] focused
on incorporating margin penalty into a more feasible framework,
softmax loss, which has extensive sample-to-class comparisons.
Compared to deep metric learning methods (e.g., Triplet [3],
Tuplet [44], [12]), margin-based softmax methods conduct global
comparisons at the cost of memory consumption on holding the
center of each class as illustrated in Figure 1. Sample-to-class
comparison is more efﬁcient and stable than sample-to-sample
comparison as (1) the class number is much smaller than sample
number, and (2) each class can be represented by a smoothed
center vector which can be updated online during training. To
further improve the margin-based softmax loss, recent works focus
on the exploration of adaptive parameters [48], [49], [50], inter-
class regularization [51], [52], mining [53], [54], grouping [55],
etc.
Face Recognition under Noise. Most of the face recognition
datasets [56], [37], [9], [38] are downloaded from the Internet
by searching a pre-deﬁned celebrity list, and the original labels
are likely to be ambiguous and inaccurate [18]. Learning with
massive noisy data has recently drawn much attention in face
recognition [57], [19], [20], [21] as accurate manual annotations
can be expensive [18] or even unavailable.
Wu et al. [57] proposed a semantic bootstrap strategy, which
re-labels the noisy samples according to the probabilities of the
softmax function. However, automatic cleaning by the bootstrap-
ping rule requires time-consuming iterations (e.g. twice reﬁnement
steps are used in [57]) and the labelling quality is affected by
the capacity of the original model. Hu et al. [19] found that the
cleanness possibility of a sample can be dynamically reﬂected
by its position in the target logit distribution and presented a
noise-tolerant end-to-end paradigm by employing the idea of
weighting training samples. Zhong et al. [20] devised a noise-
resistant loss by introducing a hypothetical training label, which
is a convex combination of the original label with probability
ρ and the predicted label by the current model with probability
1 −ρ. However, computing time-varying fusion weight [19] and
designing piece-wise loss [20] contain many hand-designed hyper-
parameters. Besides, re-weighting methods are susceptible to the
performance of the initial model. Wang et al. [21] proposed
a co-mining strategy which uses the loss values as the cue to
simultaneously detect noisy labels, exchange the high-conﬁdence
clean faces to alleviate the error accumulation caused by the
sampling bias, and re-weight the predicted clean faces to make
them dominate the discriminative model training. However, the
co-mining method requires training twin networks simultaneously
and it is challenging to train large networks (e.g. ResNet100 [58])
on a large-scale dataset (e.g. MS1MV0 [37] and Celeb500K [38]).
Face Recognition with Sub-classes. Practices and theories that
lead to “sub-class” have been studied for a long time [59], [60].
The concept of “sub-class” applied in face recognition was ﬁrst
introduced in [59], [60], where a mixture of Gaussians was used
to approximate the underlying distribution of each class. For
instance, a person’s face images may be frontal view or side view,
resulting in different modalities when all images are represented
in the same data space. In [59], [60], experimental results showed
that subclass divisions can be used to effectively adapt to different
face modalities thus improve the performance of face recognition.
Wan et al. [61] further proposed a separability criterion to divide
every class into sub-classes, which have much less overlaps. The
new within-class scatter can represent multi-modality information,
therefore optimizing this within-class scatter will separate differ-
ent modalities more clearly and further increase the accuracy of
face recognition. However, these work [59], [60], [61] only em-
ployed hand-designed feature descriptor on tiny under-controlled
datasets.
Concurrent with our work, Softtriple [62] presents a multi-
center softmax loss with class-wise regularizer. These multi-
centers can depict the hidden distribution of the data [63] due to
the fact that they can capture the complex geometry of the original
data and help reduce the intra-class variance. On the ﬁne-grained
visual retrieval problem, the Softtriple [62] loss achieves better
performance than the softmax loss as capturing local clusters is
essential for this task. Even though the concept of “sub-class”
has been employed in face recognition [59], [60], [61] and ﬁne-
grained visual retrieval [62], none of these work has considered
the large-scale (e.g. 0.5 million classes) face recognition problem
under massive noise (e.g. around 50% noisy samples within the
training data).
Face Synthesis by Model Inversion. Identity-preserving face
generation [64], [65], [66], [29] has been extensively explored
under the framework of GAN [36]. Even though GAN models can
yield high-ﬁdelity images [67], [68], training a GAN’s generator
requires access to the original data. Due to the emerging concern
of data privacy, an alternative line of work in security focuses
on model inversion, that is, image synthesis from a single CNN.
Model inversion can not only help researchers to visualize neural
networks to understand their properties [69] but also can be used

ℓ2 normalization step on both embedding feature xi ∈R512 and all sub-centers W ∈R512×N×K, we get the subclass-wise similarity score
S ∈RN×K by a matrix multiplication W T xi. After a max pooling step, we can easily get the class-wise similarity score S′ ∈RN×1. Afterwards, we
calculate the arccosθyi and get the angle between the feature xi and the ground truth center Wyi. Then, we add an angular margin penalty m on
the target (ground truth) angle θyi. After that, we calculate cos(θyi + m) and multiply all logits by the feature scale s. Finally, the logits go through
the softmax function and contribute to the cross entropy loss.
for data-free distillation, quantization and pruning [33], [34], [35].
Fredrikson et al. [70] propose the model inversion attack to obtain
class images from a network through a gradient descent on the
input. As the pixel space is so large compared to the feature space,
optimizing the image pixels by gradient descent [31] requires
heavy regularization terms, such as total variation [31] or Gaussian
blur [71]. Even though previous model inversion methods [70],
[30] can transform an input image (random noise or a natural
image) to yield a high output activation for a chosen class, it
leaves intermediate representations constraint-free. Therefore, the
resulting images are not realistic, lacking natural image statistics.
The pioneer generative face recognition model is Eigen-
face [32], which can project a training face image or a new face
image (mean-subtracted) on the eigenfaces and thereby record how
that face differs from the mean face. The eigenvalue associated
with each eigenface represents how much the image vary from
the mean image in that direction. The recognition process with
the eigenface method is to project query images into the face-
space spanned by eigenfaces calculated, and to ﬁnd the closest
match to a face class in that face-space. Even though raw pixel
features used in Eigenface are substituted by the deep convo-
lutional features, the procedure of employing the statistic prior
(e.g. mean and variance) to reconstruct face images can be an
inspiration. Recently, [33], [34], [35] have proposed a data-free
method employing the statistics (e.g. mean and variance) stored
in the BN layers to restore ImageNet images. Inspired by these
works, we synthesize face images by inverting the pre-trained
ArcFace model and considering the face prior (e.g. mean and
variance) stored in the BN layers.

PROPOSED APPROACH
3.1
ArcFace
The most widely used classiﬁcation loss function, softmax loss, is
presented as follows:
L1 = −log
eW T
yixi+byi
PN
j=1 eW T
j xi+bj ,
(1)
where xi ∈Rd denotes the deep feature of the i-th sample,
belonging to the yi-th class. The embedding feature dimension
d is set to 512 in this paper following [72], [73], [13], [14].
Wj ∈Rd denotes the j-th column of the weight W ∈Rd×N,
bj ∈RN is the bias term, and the class number is N. Traditional
softmax loss is widely used in deep face recognition [4], [9].
However, the softmax loss function does not explicitly optimize
the feature embedding to enforce higher similarity for intra-class
samples and diversity for inter-class samples, which results in a
performance degeneration for deep face recognition under large
intra-class appearance variations (e.g. pose variations [74], [75]
and age gaps [76], [77]) and large-scale test scenarios [78], [79],
[80].
For simplicity, we ﬁx the bias bj = 0 as in [13]. Then, we
transform the logit [81] as W T
j xi = ∥Wj∥∥xi∥cos θj, where θj
is the angle between the weight Wj and the feature xi. Following
[13], [14], [82], we ﬁx the individual weight ∥Wj∥= 1 by
ℓ2 normalization. Following [83], [14], [82], [15], we also ﬁx
the embedding feature ∥xi∥by ℓ2 normalization and re-scale it
to s. The normalization step on features and weights makes the
predictions only depend on the angle between the feature and the
weight. The learned embedding features are thus distributed on a
hypersphere with a radius of s.
L2 = −log

j=1,j̸=yi es cos θj .
(2)
Since the embedding features are distributed around each
feature center on the hypersphere, we employ an additive angular
margin penalty m between xi and Wyi to simultaneously enhance
the intra-class compactness and inter-class discrepancy as illus-
trated in Figure 2. Since the proposed additive angular margin
penalty is equal to the geodesic distance margin penalty in the
normalized hypersphere, we name our method as ArcFace.
L3 = −log

j=1,j̸=yi es cos θj .
(3)
We select face images from 8 different identities containing
enough samples (around 1,500 images/class) to train 2-D fea-
ture embedding networks with the Norm-Softmax and ArcFace
loss, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 3, all face features
are pushed to the arc space with a ﬁxed radius based on the
feature normalization. The Norm-Softmax loss provides roughly
separable feature embedding but produces noticeable ambiguity
in decision boundaries, while the proposed ArcFace loss can
obviously enforce a more evident margin between the nearest
classes.
Numerical Similarity. In SphereFace [13], [42], ArcFace, and
CosFace [14], [15], three different kinds of margin penalty are

geodesic distance margin between closest classes becomes evident as

proposed, e.g. multiplicative angular margin m1, additive angular
margin m2, and additive cosine margin m3, respectively. From
the view of numerical analysis, different margin penalties, no
matter add on the angle [13] or cosine space [14], all enforce
the intra-class compactness and inter-class diversity by penalizing
the target logit [81]. In Figure 4(b), we plot the target logit
curves of SphereFace, ArcFace and CosFace under their best
margin settings. We only show these target logit curves within
[20◦, 100◦] because the angles between Wyi and xi start from
around 90◦(random initialization) and end at around 30◦during
ArcFace training as shown in Figure 4(a). Intuitively, there are
three numerical factors in the target logit curves that affect the
performance, i.e. the starting point, the end point and the slope.
By combining all of the margin penalties, we implement
SphereFace, ArcFace and CosFace in a united framework with
m1, m2 and m3 as the hyper-parameters.

As shown in Figure 4(b), by combining all of the above-motioned
margins (cos(m1θ + m2) −m3), we can easily get some other
target logit curves which also achieve high performance.
Geometric Difference. Despite the numerical similarity between
ArcFace and previous works, the proposed additive angular margin
has a better geometric attribute as the angular margin has the exact
correspondence to the geodesic distance. As illustrated in Figure
5, we compare the decision boundaries under the binary classiﬁ-
cation case. The proposed ArcFace has a constant linear angular
margin throughout the whole interval. By contrast, SphereFace
and CosFace only have a nonlinear angular margin.
The minor difference in margin designs can have a signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on model training. For example, the original SphereFace
[13] employs an annealing optimization strategy. To avoid diver-
gence at the beginning of training, joint supervision from softmax
is used in SphereFace to weaken the multiplicative integer margin
penalty. We implement a new version of SphereFace without the
integer requirement on the margin by employing the arc-cosine
function instead of using the complex double angle formula. In
our implementation, we ﬁnd that m = 1.35 can obtain similar
performance compared to the original SphereFace without any
convergence difﬁculty.
Other Intra and Inter Losses. Other loss functions can be
designed based on the angular representation of features and
centers. For examples, we can design a loss to enforce intra-class
compactness and inter-class discrepancy on the hypersphere.
Intra-Loss is designed to improve the intra-class compactness
by decreasing the angle/arc between the sample and the ground
truth center.

To enhance inter-class separability, RegularFace [51] explicitly
distances identities by penalizing the angle between an identity
and its nearest neighbor, while Minimum Hyper-spherical Energy
(MHE) [84] encourages the angular diversity of neuron weights in-
spired by the Thomson problem. Recently, ﬁxed classiﬁer methods
[85], [86], [87] exhibit little or no reduction in classiﬁcation per-
formance while allowing a noticeable reduction in computational
complexity, trainable parameters and communication cost. In these
methods, inter-class separability is not learned but inherited from
a pre-deﬁned high-dimensional geometry [87].
Triplet-loss aims at enlarging the angle/arc margin between
triplet samples. In FaceNet [3], Euclidean margin is applied on
the normalized features. Here, we employ the triplet-loss by the
angular representation of our features as arccos(xpos
i
xi) + m ≤
arccos(xneg

xi).
3.2
Sub-center ArcFace
Even though ArcFace has shown its power in efﬁcient and ef-
fective face feature embedding, this method assumes that training
data are clean. However, this is not true especially when the dataset
is in large scale. How to enable the margin-based softmax loss to
be robust to noise is one of the main challenges impeding the
development of face recognition [18]. In this paper, we address
this problem by proposing the idea of using sub-classes for each
identity, which can be directly adopted by ArcFace and will
signiﬁcantly increase its robustness.
As illustrated in Figure 2, we set K sub-centers for each
identity. Based on a ℓ2 normalization step on both embedding
feature xi ∈R512 and all sub-centers W ∈R512×N×K, we

In Figure 6(a), we have visualized the clustering results of one
identity from the CASIA dataset [56] after employing the sub-
center ArcFace loss (K = 10) for training. It is obvious that the
proposed sub-center ArcFace loss can automatically cluster faces
such that hard samples and noisy samples are separated away from
the dominant clean samples. Note that some sub-classes are empty
as K = 10 is too large for a particular identity. In Figure 6(b),
we show the angle distribution on the CASIA dataset [56]. We
use the pre-trained ArcFace model to predict the feature center of
each identity and then calculate the angle between the sample and
its corresponding feature center. As we can see from Figure 6(b),
most of the samples are close to their centers, however, there are
some noisy samples which are far away from their centers. This
observation on the CASIA dataset matches the noise percentage
estimation (9.3% ∼13.0%) in [18]. To automatically obtain
a clean training dataset, the noisy tail is usually removed by
a hard threshold (e.g. angle ≥77◦or cosine ≤0.225). Since
sub-center ArcFace can automatically divide the training samples
into dominant sub-classes and non-dominant sub-classes, clean
samples (in red) can be separated from hard and noisy samples (in
blue). More speciﬁcally, the majority of clean faces (85.6%) go to
the dominant sub-class, while the rest hard and noisy faces go to
the non-dominant sub-classes.
Even though using sub-classes can improve the robustness
under noise, it undermines the intra-class compactness as hard
samples are also kept away as shown in Figure 6(b). In [37],
MS1MV0 (around 10M images of 100K identities) is released
with the estimated noise percentage around 47.1% ∼54.4% [18].
In [88], MS1MV0 is reﬁned by a semi-automatic approach into a
clean dataset named MS1MV3 (around 5.1M images of 93K iden-
tities). Based on these two datasets, we can get the clean and noisy
labels on MS1MV0. In Figure 7(b) and Figure 7(c), we show the
angle distributions of samples to their closest sub-centers (training
settings: [MS1MV0, ResNet50, Sub-center ArcFace K=3]). In
general, there are four categories of samples: (1) easy clean sam-
ples belonging to dominant sub-classes (57.24%), (2) hard noisy
samples belonging to dominant sub-classes (12.40%), (3) hard
clean samples belonging to non-dominant sub-classes (4.28%),
and (4) easy noisy samples belonging to non-dominant sub-classes
(26.08%). In Figure 7(a), we show the angle distribution of
samples to their corresponding centers from the ArcFace model
(training settings: [MS1MV0, ResNet50, ArcFace K=1]). By
comparing the percentages of noisy samples in Figure 7(b) and
Figure 7(a), we ﬁnd that sub-center ArcFace can signiﬁcantly
decrease the noise rate to around one third (from 38.47% to
12.40%) and this is the reason why sub-center ArcFace is more
robust under noise. During the training of sub-center ArcFace,
samples belonging to non-dominant sub-classes are pushed to be
close to these non-dominant sub-centers as shown in Figure 7(c).
Since we have not set any constraint on sub-centers, the sub-
centers of each identity can be quite different and even orthogonal.
In Figure 7(d), we show the angle distributions of non-dominant
samples to their dominant sub-centers. By combining Figure 7(b)
and Figure 7(d), we ﬁnd that the clean and noisy data have some
overlaps but a constant angle threshold (between 70◦and 80◦)
can be easily searched to drop most of the high-conﬁdent noisy
samples.
Based on the above observations, we propose a straightforward
approach to recapture intra-class compactness. We directly drop
non-dominant sub-centers after the network has enough discrimi-
native power. Meanwhile, we introduce a constant angle threshold
to drop high-conﬁdent noisy data. After that, we retrain the
ArcFace model from scratch on the automatically cleaned dataset.
3.3
Inversion of ArcFace
In the above sections, we have explored how the proposed Ar-
cFace can enhance the discriminative power of a face recognition
model. In this section, we take a pre-trained ArcFace model as a
white-box and reconstruct identity preserved as well as visually
plausible face images only using the gradient of the ArcFace loss
and the face statistic priors (e.g. mean and variance) stored in the
BN layers. As shown in Figure 8 and illustrated in Algorithm 1, the
pre-trained ArcFace model has encoded substantial information of

Fig. 8. ArcFace is not only a discriminative model but also a generative
model. Given a pre-trained ArcFace model, a random input tensor can
be gradually updated into a pre-deﬁned identity by using the gradient of
the ArcFace loss as well as the face statistic priors stored in the Batch
Normalization layers.

the training distribution. The distribution, stored in BN layers via
running mean and running variance, can be effectively employed
to generate visually plausible face images, avoiding convergence
outside natural faces with high conﬁdence.
Besides the ArcFace loss (Eq. 3) to preserve identity, we also
consider the following statistic priors during face generation:

where µr
i /σr
i are the mean/standard deviation of the distribution at
layer i, and µi/σi are the corresponding mean/standard deviation
parameters stored in the i-th BN layer of a pre-trained ArcFace
model. After jointly optimizing Eq. 3 and Eq. 8 (L3 + λL8, λ =
0.05) for T steps as in Algorithm 1, we can generate faces, when
fed into the network, not only have same identity as the pre-deﬁned
identity but also have a statistical distribution that closely matches
the original data set.
The above approach exploits the relationship between an input
image and its class label for the reconstruction process. As the
output similarity score is ﬁxed according to predeﬁned N classes,
the reconstruction is limited on images of training subjects. To
solve open-set face generation from the embedding feature, the
constraints on predeﬁned classes need to be removed. Therefore,
we substitute the classiﬁcation loss to the ℓ2 loss between feature
pairs. Open-set face generation can restore the face image from
any embedding feature, while close-set face generation only re-
constructs face images from the class centers stored in the linear
weight.
Concurrent with our work, [33], [34], [35] have proposed a
data-free method employing the BN priors to restore ImageNet
images for distillation, quantization and pruning. Their model
inversion results contain obvious artifact in the background due
to the translation augmentation during training. By contrast, our
ArcFace model is trained on normalized face crops without back-
ground, thus the restored faces exhibit less artifact. Besides, these

Implementation Details
Training Datasets. As given in Table 1, we separately employ
CASIA [56], VGG2 [9], MS1MV0 [37] and Celeb500K [38] as
our training data in order to conduct fair comparison with other
methods. MS1MV0 (loose cropped version) [37] is a raw data
with the estimated noise percentage around 47.1% ∼54.4%
[18]. MS1MV3 [88] is cleaned from MS1MV0 [37] by a semi-
automatic approach. We employ ethnicity-speciﬁc annotators (e.g.
African, Caucasian, Indian and Asian) for large-scale face image
annotations, as the boundary cases (e.g. hard samples and noisy
samples) are very hard to distinguish if the annotator is not
familiar with the identity. Celeb500K [38] is collected in the
same way as MS1MV0 [37], using the celebrity name list [37]
to search identities from Google and download the top-ranked
face images. We download 25M images of 500K identities, and
employ RetinaFace [8] to detect faces larger than 50×50 from the
original images. By employing the proposed sub-center ArcFace,
we can automatically clean MS1MV0 [37] and Celeb500K [38].
After removing the overlap identities (about 50K) through the
ID string, we combine the automatically cleaned MS1MV0 and
Celeb500K and obtain a large-scale face image dataset, named
IBUG-500K, including 11.96 million images of 493K identities.
Figure 9 illustrates the gender, race, pose, age and image number
distributions of the proposed IBUG-500K dataset.
Test Datasets. During training, we explore efﬁcient face veriﬁca-
tion datasets (e.g. LFW [89], CFP-FP [74], AgeDB [76]) to check
the convergence status of the model. Besides the most widely used
LFW [89] and YTF [90] datasets, we also report the performance
of ArcFace on the recent datasets (e.g. CPLFW [75] and CALFW
[77]) with large pose and age variations. We also extensively
test the proposed ArcFace on large-scale image datasets (e.g.
MegaFace [78], IJB-B [79], IJB-C [80] and LFR2019-Image [88])

and large-scale video datasets (LFR2019-Video [88]). Detailed
dataset statistics are presented in Table 1. For the LFR2019-Image
dataset, there are 274K images from the 5.7K LFW identities [89]
and 1.58M distractors downloaded from Flickr. For the LFR2019-
Video dataset, there are 200K videos of 10K identities collected
from various shows, ﬁlms and television dramas. The length of
each video ranges from 1 to 30 seconds. Both the LFR2019-Image
dataset and the LFR2019-Video dataset are manually cleaned
to ensure the unbiased evaluation of different face recognition
models.
Experimental Settings. For data prepossessing, we follow the
recent papers [13], [14] to generate the normalized face crops
(112×112) by utilizing ﬁve facial points predicted by RetinaFace
[8]. For the embedding network, we employ the widely used CNN
architectures, ResNet50 and ResNet100 [58], [91] without the
bottleneck structure. After the last convolutional layer, we explore
the BN [92]-Dropout [93]-FC-BN structure to get the ﬁnal 512-
D embedding feature. In this paper, we use ([training dataset,
network structure, loss]) to facilitate understanding of different
experimental settings.
We follow [14] to set the feature scale s to 64 and choose the
angular margin m of ArcFace at 0.5. All recognition experiments
in this paper are implemented by MXNet [39]. We set the batch
size to 512 and train models on eight NVIDIA Tesla P40 (24GB)
GPUs. We set the momentum to 0.9 and weight decay to 5e −4.
For the ArcFace training, we employ the SGD optimizer and
follow [14], [9] to design the learning rate schedules for different
datasets. On CASIA, the learning rate starts from 0.1 and is
divided by 10 at 20, 28 epochs. The training process is ﬁnished
at 32 epochs. On VGG2, the learning rate is decreased at 6, 9
epochs and we ﬁnish training at 12 epochs. On MS1MV3 and
IBUG-500K, we refer to the veriﬁcation accuracy on CFP-FP and
AgeDB to reduce the learning rate at 8, 14 epochs and terminate
at 18 epochs.
For the training of the proposed sub-center ArcFace on
MS1MV0 [37], we also employ the same learning rate schedule
as on MS1MV3 to train the ﬁrst round of model (K=3). Then, we
drop non-dominant sub-centers (K = 3 ↓1) and high-conﬁdent
noisy data (> 75◦) by using the ﬁrst round model through an
off-line way. Finally, we retrain the model from scratch using the
automatically cleaned data. For the experiments of the sub-center
ArcFace on Celeb500K [38], the only difference is the learning
rate schedule, which is same as on IBUG-500K.
During testing of the face recognition models, we only keep
the feature embedding network without the fully connected layer
(160MB for ResNet50 and 250MB for ResNet100) and extract
the 512-D features (8.9 ms/face for ResNet50 and 15.4 ms/face
for ResNet100) for each normalized face. To get the embedding
features for templates (e.g. IJB-B and IJB-C) or videos (e.g. YTF
and LFR2019-Video), we simply calculate the feature center of all

Ablation Study on ArcFace
In Table 2, we ﬁrst explore the angular margin setting for ArcFace
on the CASIA dataset with ResNet50. The best margin observed
in our experiments is 0.5. Using the proposed combined margin
framework in Eq. 4, it is easier to set the margin of SphereFace
and CosFace which we ﬁnd to have optimal performance when
setting at 1.35 and 0.35, respectively. Our implementations for
both SphereFace and CosFace can lead to excellent performance
without observing any difﬁculty in convergence. The proposed
ArcFace achieves the highest veriﬁcation accuracy on all three
test sets. In addition, we perform extensive experiments with the
combined margin framework (some of the best performance is
observed for CM1 (1, 0.3, 0.2) and CM2 (0.9, 0.4, 0.15)) guided
by the target logit curves in Figure 4(b). The combined margin
framework leads to better performance than individual SphereFace
and CosFace but upper-bounded by the performance of ArcFace.
Besides the comparison with margin-based methods, we con-
duct a further comparison between ArcFace and other losses which
aim at enforcing intra-class compactness (Eq. 5) and inter-class
discrepancy (Eq. 6). As the baseline, we choose the softmax
loss. After weight and feature normalization, we have observed
obvious performance drops on CFP-FP and AgeDB with the
feature re-scale parameter s set as 64. To obtain comparable
performance as the softmax loss, we have searched the best scale

parameter s = 20 for Norm-Softmax. By combining the Norm-
Softmax with the intra-class loss, the performance improves on
CFP-FP and AgeDB. However, combining the Norm-Softmax
with the inter-class loss only slightly improves the accuracy.
Employing margin penalty within triplet samples is less effective
than inserting margin between samples and centers as in ArcFace,
indicating local comparisons in the Triplet loss are not as effective
as global comparisons in ArcFace. Finally, we incorporate the
Intra-loss, Inter-loss and Triplet-loss into ArcFace, but no obvious
improvement is observed, which leads us to believe that ArcFace is
already enforcing intra-class compactness, inter-class discrepancy
and classiﬁcation margin.
4.3
Ablation Study on Sub-center ArcFace
In Table 3, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate
the proposed sub-center ArcFace on noisy training data (e.g.
MS1MV0 [37] and Celeb500K [38]). Models trained on the
manually cleaned MS1MV3 [88] are taken as the reference. We
train ResNet50 networks under different settings and evaluate
the performance by adopting TPR@FPR=1e-4 on IJB-C, which
is more objective and less affected by the noise within the test
data [94].
From Table 3, we have the following observations:

ArcFace has an obvious performance drop (from (14)
96.50% to (1) 90.27%) when the training data is changed
from the clean MS1MV3 to the noisy MS1MV0. By
contrast, sub-center ArcFace is more robust ((2) 93.72%)
under massive noise.
•
Too many sub-centers (too large K) can obviously under-
mine the intra-class compactness and decrease the accu-
racy (from (2) 93.72% to (5) 67.94%). This observation
indicates that noise tolerance and intra-class compactness
should be balanced during training. Considering the GPU
memory consumption, we select K=3 in this paper.
•
The nearest sub-center assignment by the max pooling is
slightly better than the softmax pooling [62] ((2) 93.72%
vs. (3) 93.55%). Thus, we choose the more efﬁcient max
pooling operator in the following experiments.
•
Dropping non-dominant sub-centers and high-conﬁdent
noisy samples can achieve better performance than adding
regularization [62] to enforce compactness between sub-
centers ((7) 95.92% vs. (10) 93.64%). Besides, the perfor-
mance of our method is not very sensitive to the constant
threshold ((6) 95.91%, (7) 95.92% and (8) 95.74%), and
we select 75◦as the threshold for dropping high-conﬁdent
noisy samples in the following experiments.
•
Co-mining [21] and re-weighting methods [19], [20] can
also improve the robustness under massive noise, but sub-
center ArcFace can do better through automatic clean and
noisy data isolation during training ((7) 95.92% vs. (11)
93.82%, (12) 93.65% and (13) 93.60%).
•
On the clean dataset (MS1MV3), sub-center ArcFace
achieves similar performance as ArcFace ((16) 96.43%
vs. (14) 96.50%). By employing the threshold of 75◦
on MS1MV3, 4.18% hard samples are removed, but the
performance only slightly decreases, thus we estimate
MS1MV3 still contains some noises.
•
The proposed sub-center ArcFace trained on noisy
MS1MV0 can achieve comparable performance compared
to ArcFace trained on manually cleaned MS1MV3 ((7)
95.92% vs. (14) 96.50%).
•
By enlarging the training data, sub-center ArcFace can
easily achieve better performance even though it is trained
from noisy web faces ((19) 96.91% vs. (13) 96.50%).

Benchmark Results
Results on LFW, YTF, CFP-FP, CPLFW, AgeDB, CALFW.
LFW [89] and YTF [90] datasets are the most widely used bench-
mark for unconstrained face veriﬁcation on images and videos.
In this paper, we follow the unrestricted with labelled outside
data protocol to report the performance. As reported in Table
4, ArcFace models trained on MS1MV3 and IBUG-500K with
ResNet100 beat the baselines (e.g. SphereFace [13] and CosFace
[14]) on both LFW and YTF, which shows that the additive angular
margin penalty can notably enhance the discriminative power
of deeply learned features, demonstrating the effectiveness of
ArcFace. As the margin-based softmax loss has been widely used
in recent methods, the performance begins to be saturated around
99.8% and 98.0% on LFW and YTF, respectively. However,
the proposed ArcFace is still among the most competitive face
recognition methods.
Besides on LFW and YTF datasets, we also report the per-
formance of ArcFace on the recently introduced datasets (e.g.
CFP-FP [74], CPLFW [75], AgeDB [76] and CALFW [77])
which show large pose and age variations. Among all of the
recent face recognition models, our ArcFace models trained on
MS1MV3 and IBUG-500K are evaluated as the top-ranked face
recognition models as shown in Table 5, outperforming coun-
terparts by an obvious margin on the pose-invariant and age-
invariant face recognition. In Figure 10, we show the results of
ArcFace model trained on IBUG-500K by illustrating the angle
distributions of both positive and negative pairs on LFW, YTF,
CFP-FP, CPLFW, AgeDB and CALFW. We can clearly ﬁnd that
the intra-variance due to pose and age gaps signiﬁcantly increases
the angles between positive pairs thus making the best threshold
for face veriﬁcation increasing and generating more confusion
regions on the histogram.

Results on MegaFace. The MegaFace dataset [78] includes 1M
images of 690K different individuals as the gallery set and 100K
photos of 530 unique individuals from FaceScrub [112] as the
probe set. As we observed an obvious performance gap between
identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation in the previous work (e.g. CosFace
[14]), we performed a thorough manual check in the whole
MegaFace dataset and found many face images with wrong labels,
which signiﬁcantly affects the performance. Therefore, we man-
ually reﬁned the whole MegaFace dataset and report the correct
performance of ArcFace on MegaFace. In Table 6, we use “R”
to denote the reﬁned version of MegaFace and the performance
comparisons also focus on the reﬁned version.
On MegaFace, there are two testing scenarios (identiﬁcation
and veriﬁcation) under two protocols (large or small training set).
The training set is deﬁned as large if it contains more than 0.5M
images. For the fair comparison, we train ArcFace on CASIA

and IBUG-500K under the small protocol and large protocol,
respectively. In Table 6, ArcFace trained on CASIA achieves the
best single-model identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation performance, not
only surpassing the strong baselines (e.g. SphereFace [13] and
CosFace [14]) but also outperforming other published methods
[72], [84].
Under the large protocol, ArcFace trained on IBUG-500K
surpasses ArcFace trained on MS1MV3 by a clear margin (0.47%
improvement on identiﬁcation), which indicates that large-scale
training data is very beneﬁcial and the proposed sub-center Arc-
Face is effective for automatic data cleaning under different data
scales. As shown in Figure 11, ArcFace trained on IBUG-500K
forms an upper envelope of other models under both identiﬁcation
and veriﬁcation scenarios. Compared to MC-FaceGraph [109],
ArcFace trained on IBUG-500K obtains comparable results on

identiﬁcation and better results on veriﬁcation. Considering 18.8M
images of 636K identities are used in MC-FaceGraph [109], the
performance of our method is very impressive, as we only use
images automatically cleaned from noisy web data. Similar to
LFW, the identiﬁcation results on MegaFace are also saturated
(around 99%). Therefore, the performance gap of 0.04% on
identiﬁcation is negligible and our model is among the most
competitive face recognition methods.
Results on IJB-B and IJB-C. The IJB-B dataset [79] contains
1, 845 subjects with 21.8K still images and 55K frames from
7, 011 videos. The IJB-C dataset [79] is a further extension of
IJB-B, having 3, 531 subjects with 31.3K still images and 117.5K
frames from 11, 779 videos. On IJB-B and IJB-C datasets, there
are two evaluation protocols, 1:1 veriﬁcation and 1:N identiﬁca-
tion.
For the widely used 1:1 veriﬁcation protocol, there are 12, 115
templates with 10, 270 genuine matches and 8M impostor matches
on IJB-B, and there are 23, 124 templates with 19, 557 genuine
matches and 15, 639K impostor matches on IJB-C. In Table 7,
we compare the TPR (@FPR=1e-4) of ArcFace with the previous
state-of-the-art models. We ﬁrst employ the VGG2 [9] dataset as

the training data and the ResNet50 as the embedding network
to train ArcFace for the fair comparison with the most recent
softmax-based methods [9], [113], [94]. As we can see from
the results, the proposed additive angular margin can obviously
boost the performance on both IJB-B and IJB-C compared to the
softmax loss (about 3 ∼5%, which is a signiﬁcant reduction in
the error).
Drawing support from more training data (IBUG-500K) and
deeper neural network (ResNet100), ArcFace can further im-
prove the TPR (@FPR=1e-4) to 96.02% and 97.27% on IJB-
B and IJB-C, respectively. Compared to the joint margin-based
and mining-based method (e.g. CurricularFace [54]), our method
further decreases the error rate by 22.57% and 29.09% on IJB-B
and IJB-C, which indicates that the automatically cleaned data

(b) ROC for LFR2019-Video

and LFR2019-Video datasets. ([MS1MV3, EfﬁcientNet-B0, ArcFace])
by the proposed sub-center ArcFace are effective to boost the
performance. In Table 8, we compare the proposed sub-center
ArcFace with FaceGraph [109] on large-scale cleansing. In Face-
Graph [109], one million celebrities (87.0M face images) [37] are
cleaned into a noise-free dataset named MC-FaceGraph (including
18.8M face images of 636.2K identities) by employing a global-
local graph convolutional network. Even though the proposed
sub-center ArcFace is only applied to half million identities, the
cleaned dataset, IBUG-500K (including 11.96M face images of
493K identities), still outperforms MC-FaceGraph [109]. Under
the evaluation metric of TPR@FPR=1e-5, the ArcFace model
trained on IBUG-500K surpasses the counterpart trained on MC-
FaceGraph by 0.66% and 0.45% on IJB-B and IJB-C, respec-
tively. In Figure 12, we show the full ROC curves of the proposed
ArcFace on IJB-B and IJB-C, and ArcFace achieves impressive
performance even at FPR=1e-6 setting a new baseline.
For the 1:N end-to-end mixed protocol, there are 10, 270 probe
templates containing 60, 758 still images and video frames on
IJB-B, and there are 19, 593 probe templates containing 127, 152
still images and video frames on IJB-C. In Table 8, we report the
Rank-1 identiﬁcation accuracy of our method compared to base-
line models. ArcFace trained on IBUG-500K achieves impressive
performance on both IJB-B (95.94%) and IJB-C (97.21%), setting
a new record on this benchmark.
Results on LFR2019-Image and LFR2019-Video. Lightweight
Face Recognition (LFR) Challenge [88] targets on bench-marking
face recognition methods under strict computation constraints (i.e.
computational complexity < 1.0 GFlops). For a fair comparison,
all participants in the challenge must use MS1MV3 [88] as the
training data. On LFR2019-Image, trillion-level pairs between
gallery and probe set are used for evaluation and TPR@FPR=1e-
8 is selected as the main evaluation metric. On LFR2019-Video,
billion-level pairs between all videos are used for evaluation and
TPR@FPR=1e-4 is employed as the main evaluation metric.
In Table 9, we compare the performance of ArcFace with
the top-ranked competition solutions [88]. For the design of
Fig. 14. Close-set face generation. ArcFace can generate identity-
preserved face images only by using the model parameters without
training any additional discriminator and generator like in GAN. The ﬁrst
column is the identity from the training data. Column 2 to 4 are the
outputs from our ArcFace model. Column 5 to 7 are the outputs from
the baseline CosFace model.
our lightweight model, we explore EfﬁcientNet-B0 [118] as the
backbone. When training from scratch with the proposed Ar-
cFace loss, EfﬁcientNet-B0 can obtain 86.44% on LFR2019-
Image and 61.47% on LFR2019-Video, respectively. Following
the top-ranked solutions, we also employ knowledge distillation
[119] to boost the performance of our lightweight model. Ar-
cFace trained on MS1MV3 with ResNet100 provides a high-
performance teacher network, achieving 92.75% on LFR2019-
Image and 64.89% on LFR2019-Video. With the assistance of the
teacher network, our lightweight model is trained by minimizing
(1) the ArcFace loss (2) the ℓ2 regression loss between 512-D
features of the teacher and student networks, and (3) the KL
loss [119] between class-wise similarities predicted by the teacher
and student networks. The weights of the ℓ2 regression loss and
the KL loss is set to 1.0 and 0.1, respectively. With knowledge
distillation, our method ﬁnally achieves 88.65% on LFR2019-
Image and 63.60% on LFR2019-Video. As shown in Figure 13,
our method obtains comparable performance with the champion
of the LFR2019-Image track and envelops the ROC curves of
all top-ranked challenge solutions in the LFR2019-Video track,
surpassing the champion by 0.37%.

Inversion of ArcFace
This section demonstrates the capability of the proposed ArcFace
model in terms of effectively synthesizing identity-preserved face
images from subject’s centers (the close-set setting) or features
(the open-set setting).
We adopt the ArcFace (ResNet50) trained on MS1MV3 to
conduct the inversion experiments, which include two settings,

gender confusion) generated from the ArcFace inversion.

14
mode, embedding features predicted by the pre-trained models are
used as the targets to generate face images. Identity preservation
is constrained by a ℓ2 loss. For each time, we synthesize 256 face
images of different identities at the resolution of 112 × 112 in
one mini-batch using one NVIDIA V100 GPU. We employ Adam
optimizer [120] at a learning rate of 0.25 and the iteration lasts
20K steps. Regularization parameters [30] for total variance and
ℓ2 norm of the generated faces are set as 1e −3 and 1e −4,
respectively.
In order to quantitatively validate how well the proposed
method can preserve the identity of the subject and how visu-
ally plausible the reconstructed face image is, three metrics are
adopted: (1) Frechet Inception Distance (FID) [121]; (2) cosine
similarity from a third-party model ([IBUG-500K, ResNet100,
ArcFace]); and (3) face veriﬁcation accuracy on LFW for open-set
experiments.
Close-set Face Generation. In Table 10, we quantify the realism
and identity preservation of the reconstructed faces from different
face recognition models. For each model, we synthesize training
identities by using the 5K randomly selected class indexes. For
each identity, different random inputs are gradually updated by
the network gradient into identity-preserved face images. The
proposed ArcFace model obviously outperforms the baseline
methods (e.g. softmax, SphereFace and CosFace) in the image
quality, achieving the FID score of 70.39. By employing the
powerful ArcFace model trained on IBUG-500K, we calculate all
cosine similarities between real training faces and corresponding
generated faces. The average cosine similarity of ArcFace is
0.6248, surpassing all the baseline models by a clear margin.
In Figure 14, we show the synthesized faces from the proposed
ArcFace in comparison with the baseline CosFace model. As can
be seen, ArcFace is able to reconstruct identity-preserved faces
only by using the model parameters without training any addi-
tional discriminator and generator like in GAN [36]. Considering
the image quality is only constrained by the classiﬁcation loss
and the BN priors, it is quite understandable that there exist some
identity-unrelated artifacts in the generation results. Besides, there
are many grey images in MS1MV3 and this statistic information
is also stored in the BN parameters, thus some generated faces
are not colorful. Compared to the baseline CosFace model, our
ArcFace can depict better facial features of the real faces in terms
of identity preservation and image quality.
Open-set Face Generation. In Table 11, we compare inversion
results of different models on LFW. For each pre-trained model,
we ﬁrst calculate the embedding features of 13,233 face images
from LFW, and then we generate faces constrained to these target
features through a ℓ2 loss. As we can see, ArcFace maintains
best reconstruction quality and identity preservation, consistently
outperforming the baseline models in both FID and average
cosine similarity metrics. On the real faces of LFW, the ArcFace
model (ResNet50) achieves 99.81% veriﬁcation accuracy. On the
generated faces, the veriﬁcation accuracy slightly drops to 97.75%
by using the same model ([MS1MV3, ResNet50, ArcFace]) for
testing. For unbiased evaluation, we report the matching accuracy
on LFW by employing the powerful ArcFace model (ResNet100)
trained on IBUG-500K and this model is more susceptible to
artifacts in the generated results. Even though there is a further
drop in the veriﬁcation accuracy (93.30%), the results compared
to the baseline models further demonstrate the advantages of
ArcFace in the inversion problem.
Figure 15 illustrates our synthesis from features of LFW faces
that contain appearance variations (e.g. age, gender, race, pose and
occlusion). Similar to the previous experiment, our ArcFace model
robustly depicts identity-preserved faces. The success of robustly
handling with those challenging factors comes from two proper-
ties: (1) the ArcFace network was trained to ignore those facial
variations in its embedding features, and (2) real face distributions
stored in the BN layers can be effectively exploited for face image
synthesis. Even though ArcFace can inverse most of the faces
with realism and identity preservation, there exist some confusions
during generation. In Figure 15(f), we show some inversion results
from ArcFace containing gender confusions. Even though these
confusions can be easily distinguished by human eyes, they exhibit
high similarity from the view of the machine. In Figure 16, we
further conduct an ablation study about ArcFace inversion without
BN constraints. As we can see from these results, constraints
from the BN layers can enforce the generated face more visually
plausible. Without the BN constraints, the resulting face images
lack natural image statistics and can be quite easily identiﬁed as
unnatural.

CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we ﬁrst propose an Additive Angular Margin
Loss function, named ArcFace, which can effectively enhance
the discriminative power of deep feature embedding for face
recognition. We further introduce sub-class into ArcFace to relax
the intra-class constraint under massive real-world noises. The
proposed sub-center ArcFace encourages one dominant sub-class
that contains the majority of clean faces and non-dominant sub-
classes that include hard or noisy faces. This automatic isola-
tion can be employed to clean large-scale web faces and we
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the state
of the art through the most comprehensive experiments. Apart
from enhancing discriminative power, ArcFace can also strengthen
the model’s generative power, mapping feature vectors to face
images. The pre-trained ArcFace model can generate identity-
preserved face images for both subjects inside and outside the
training data only by using the network gradient and BN priors.
As the proposed ArcFace inversion only focuses on approximating
the target identity feature, the facial poses and expressions are not
controllable. In the future, we will explore controlling intermediate
neuron activations to target speciﬁc facial poses and expressions
during inversion. In addition, we will also explore how to make the
face recognition model not invertible so that face images cannot
be easily reconstructed from model weights to protect privacy.
